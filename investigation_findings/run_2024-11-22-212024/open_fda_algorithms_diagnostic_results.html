arthroplasties: can we substitute mars mri with ct?¿ which attempts to determine whether ct is a suitable substitute for mars mri in evaluation of the painful mom-ha. this study involved fifty (50) patients who had unexplained pain. three of the fifty patients received a biomet manufactured hip (1 recap magnum, one taperloc magnum and one biomet modular prosthesis). the journal article reports adverse events due to the following reasons: twenty-five (25) pseudotumors were detected. fifteen (15) reports of osteolysis. evidence of moderate or severe muscle atrophy was present to varying extents in forty-nine of fifty patients with unexplained hip pain. it is unknown which hip system the patients that experienced the adverse events listed above received. the journal article concludes that, while both modalities have been used successfully to evaluate the soft tissues of such patients, it was found that mars mri is superior to ct for the <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> and characterization of pseudotumor and muscle atrophy with a view to patient management and operative planning. in addition, it was determined that ct is a more effective modality for detecting periprosthetic bony changes in mom hips than mars mri. based on the findings, the authors advocate a multimodal assessment of symptomatic patients to detect the full spectrum of mom-associated pathologies in the most sensitive way. for these patients, a single-modality <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> would prove to be less useful..this record will address: the journal article identifies pseudotumors were diagnosed in 25 of 50 hips. it is unknown which hip system the patients that experienced the adverse events listed above received. there has been no further information provided and

was received based on review of a journal article titled,"cross-sectional imaging of metal-on-metal hip arthroplasties- can we substitute mars mri with ct?", which followed fifty (50) metal on metal hip arthroplasties (mom-has) patients (thirty (30) female) with unexplained painful prostheses who underwent mars mri and ct imaging. the journal article reports that pseudotumor was diagnosed in 25 of 50 hips by mars mri and in 11 of 50 by ct. the types of prosthesis implanted in these fifty patients are four asr, one taperloc magnum and one biomet modular among other competitors. the findings also showed the following: evidence of moderate or severe muscle atrophy (> 30% reduction in muscle bulk) was present to varying extents in forty- nine (49) of fifty (50) patients with unexplained hip pain. osteolysis was identified in fifteen (15) of fifty (50) patients. osteolytic lesions were noted in four (4) patients. the authors of the study conclude that ct was found to be superior to mri for detection of osteolysis adjacent to mom-ha, and should be incorporated into <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>s. ct was unable to classify and failed to detect many pseudotumors, and it was unreliable for assessment of muscle atrophy. where mars mri is contraindicated or unavailable, ct would be an unsuitable substitute and other modalities such as

manufacture, the complaint is deemed as unconfirmed..the plant investigation is in process. a supplemental mdr will be submitted upon completion of this activity. clinical review: there is a temporal relationship between peritoneal dialysis and utilization of the liberty cycler set and the patient event of peritonitis and subsequent hospitalization. however, there is no documentation in the

manufacturing records, review of the customer¿s data and verification of complaints history. review of the manufacturing records indicated that the qc results were compliant. the customer observed the curves in the pdf report and noticed amplification in the cy5 channel (stx target), as well as in the rox channel (shigella target). the customer was thus worried about a potential false shigella negative result. run 4033, performed on (b)(6) on instrument cm0123 was received for analysis. overall, curves analysis showed no anomaly. for the sample in position b4, for which the customer was complaining, a positive result was obtained for the stx target, detected in the cy5 channel, whereas a negative result was obtained for the other targets. curves were analyzed and showed that the ct values were similar for the stx and shigella target but the end point (ep) value obtained for the stx target was very high whereas the ep value obtained for the shigella target was very low, explaining the negative result for the shigella target. moreover, customer confirmed that the reference method identified only e.coli o157 (containing the stx gene) in this sample, confirming the bd max¿ ebp result. the low curve obtained in the rox channel could be explained by channel crosstalk but it did not generate incorrect results. the crosstalk can be the result of improper bd max¿ instrument reader calibration/normalization. nonetheless, the shigella negative result provided by the instrument was a true negative result. the bd max¿ ebp <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> and product performed as expected. the product is not suspected to be the cause of the customer¿s issue. there is no complaint trend for false negative result for the bd max enteric bacterial panel lot 0164106. the root cause was not identified as no issue was found. bd cannot confirm the complaint based on the investigation that was performed. bd suggest to have the bd max instrument verified for

tc70 interpreted an ecg (electrocardiogram) incorrectly and missed prolonged qt interval as the interpretation. it was reported that the patient passed away later that day after being released from the hospital. the device was in clinical use at the time the reported issue was discovered. philips technical support was able to remotely interview the customer with the reported problem via phone conversation and emails. according to the provided information, on (b)(6) 2022, prior to the patient¿s discharge, a 12 lead ecg was performed twice using a pagewriter tc70 cardiograph. the first ecg was taken at 17:46. the ph100b version of the dxl 12-lead ecg <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> identified atrial fibrillation (afib) and right bundle branch block (rbbb), also stating abnormal ecg with an unconfirmed <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b>. the qt and qtc values (measurement made on the electrocardiogram used to assess some of the electrical properties of the heart) for this ecg were 351 ms and 502 ms, respectively. note that ¿unconfirmed <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b>¿ indicates that the ecg report was not overread by a qualified physician. a second ecg was taken at 19:03 which again showed rbbb, as well as sinus rhythm and a borderline short pr interval. similarly, the readout stated abnormal ecg with an unconfirmed <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b>. the qt and qtc values for this ecg were 577 ms and 591 ms, respectively. the patient was discharged from the hospital at 20:15. following release from the hospital the patient passed away, with the cause of death unknown. after a review of the ecg paper print, it was found that the automated interpretation did not show a prolonged qt interval which, based on the qtc value for both ecgs, should have occurred. the doctor believes the tc70 interpreted the ecg incorrectly and missed the prolonged qt interval on the interpretation statement. the doctor stated that had the tc70 provided the correct interpretation, they would not have sent the patient home. per the device¿s ifu (instructions for use), qtc greater than 465 ms is considered as borderline prolonged qtc. an additional 20 ms qualifies the condition as prolonged qtc. additionally, a significantly prolonged qtc interval greater than 520 ms is considered to be due to hypocalcemia (deficiency of calcium in the bloodstream). for the first ecg, a ¿prolonged qt interval¿ statement should have displayed. for the second ecg, a ¿prolonged qt interval suggests hypocalcemia¿ statement should have displayed. according to the hospital contact, the site does not have ecg management software, nor do they save ecg files on the device¿s internal memory. the only technical readouts saved by the site are in the form of an ecg paper print, which is subsequently scanned into the medical record system. therefore, it is not possible to evaluate why the <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> used did not correctly generate the interpretive statement of prolonged qt interval. an issue impact assessment ((b)(4)) has been initiated. a 54 complaint search (01 jan 2018 ¿ 01 july 2022) for philips cardiograph products has found only 1 complaint which detailed as patient serious injury (s3) or (s4) harm depending on the criteria established in each in-scope sra. over the span of this 54-month timeframe, there were 1,200,731,498 opportunities for use with philips cardiograph products. the observed residual risk is within the acceptable risk levels according to the standards of the dxl 12/16 lead ecg <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> sra document. based on the conclusion of this assessment, no correction or removal is required. however, it is recommended to add two new hazardous situations to all in-scope products¿ sras, one covering a missed prolonged qt interval interpretation statement, and one covering a general missed interpretation statement. any additional investigation or action taken will be documented in the respective records..the customer reported that the tc70 interpreted an ecg incorrectly and missed prolonged qt interval as the interpretation. it was reported that the

administered symptomatically: oral calcium carbonate supplementation (2 3 750 mg) or intravenous (iv) calcium gluconate (2 g in 50-500 ml normal saline solution). from the 94 autologous procedures, 22 procedures (23%) required symptomatic calcium administration. for 11 procedures oral calcium carbonate supplementation was sufficient, five procedures required iv administration of calcium gluconate, and in six procedures both iv calcium gluconate and oral calcium carbonate were administered. ce2 was somewhat higher in the allogeneic group, possibly due to the younger age of the healthy donor

which allow for a good buffy coat separation in the centrifuge. according to therapeutic apheresis: a physician's handbook, adverse events occur during therapeutic procedures with a frequency of 4.8%. some of the most common reactions include fever, urticaria, hypocalcemic symptoms, pruritus, dyspnea, tachycardia, and mild hypotension. transient hypocalcemia associated with apheresis is usually well tolerated. symptoms often show as paresthesia (tingling) but patients may also experience unusual taste, nausea, lightheadedness, shivering, and tremors. severe hypocalcemia may also cause muscle contractions and can progress to tetany and seizures if hypocalcemia escalates and is not corrected. the optia essentials guide advises the operator of possible adverse effects of apheresis procedures and to be prepared to take appropriate action should any reactions occur. some previously reported reactions are: anxiety, headache, light-headedness, digit and/or facial paresthesia, fever, chills, hematoma, hyperventilation, nausea and vomiting, syncope (fainting), urticaria, hypotension, allergic reactions. patient and donor characteristics: autologous, allogeneic, male/female: 26/25, (b)(6)

collections at a single institution from january 2013 to june 2014, the lot numbers were not provided; therefore, a dhr search could not be conducted for this specific incident. all lots must meet acceptance criteria for release. root cause: a definitive root cause for the reported citrate reactions could not be determined. these reactions occur due to decreased ionized calcium in circulation as a result of exogenous citrate administered during the apheresis procedure and are influenced by patient physiology, the patient's disease state, the donor physiology, the rate of ac infusion, the citrate contents in the replacement fluid, and/or the length of the procedure. these symptoms may be treated with oral or intravenous calcium supplements or by adjusting the ac infusion rate.</p><hr><h3 id="ALG-DIAG-031">Result ALG-DIAG-031</h3><p><a href="https://api.fda.gov/device/event.json?search=algorithm*+AND+(diagnostic*+OR+diagnosis*)&limit=500&skip=500"

hgb at the end of the transfusion episode. according to the aabb circular of information for the use of human blood components (revised 2017), transfusion-related acute lung injury (trali) is characterized by the acute onset of hypoxemia and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema within 6 hours of a blood or blood component transfusion in the absence of other causes of acute lung injury or circulatory overload. various stimuli in blood components, most commonly white blood cell (wbc) antibodies from donors sensitized during pregnancy or prior transfusion or transplantation, or proinflammatory molecules that accumulate in stored blood components may cause trali. these mechanisms may not be mutually exclusive and may act synergistically with underlying patient factors to lead to a final common pathway of acute lung injury. these stimuli may trigger an inflammatory response, granulocyte activation and degranulation, and injury to the alveolar capillary membrane and the development of permeability pulmonary edema. although most trali cases are associated with donor antileukocyte antibodies, rare cases have implicated recipient antileukocyte antibodies that reacted with donor leukocytes. widespread leukoreduction of blood components has likely mitigated this latter risk. laboratory testing of blood donors for antileukocyte antibodies or blood components for biological mediators does not alter management of this reaction, which is diagnosed on clinical and radiographic findings. treatment of trali involves aggressive preferential use of plasma collected from male donors has been associated with a significant reduction in the number of reported trali cases and associated fatalities. according to the aabb circular of information for the use of human blood and blood components (revised 2017), allergic reactions frequently occur (ie, with 1-3% of plasma-containing components) as mild or self-limiting urticaria or wheezing that usually responds to antihistamines. more severe manifestations, including respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms, are more consistent with anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions and may require more aggressive therapy. no laboratory procedures are available to predict these reactions. anaphylactic reactions characterized by hypotension, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea, abdominal pain, severe dyspnea, pulmonary and/or laryngeal edema, and bronchospasm and/or laryngospasm, are rare (<10/100,000 transfused units) but dangerous complications requiring immediate treatment with epinephrine. while these reactions have been reported in iga-deficient patients with anti-iga antibodies and patients with haptoglobin deficiency, most reactions are idiosyncratic and not associated with a specific serum protein deficiency, polymorphism, or identifiable cause. according to the aabb circular of information for the use of human blood and blood components (revised 2017), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (taco) is a frequent complication of transfusion leading to cardiogenic (hydrostatic) pulmonary edema and can occur after transfusion of excessive volumes or at excessively rapid rates. this is a particular risk in individuals with underlying cardiopulmonary or renal disease, the very young and the elderly, and in patients with chronic severe anemia in who low red cells mass is associated with high plasma volume. small transfusion volumes can precipitate symptoms in at-risk patients who already have a positive fluid balance. pulmonary edema should promptly and aggressively treated, and infusion of colloid preparations, including plasma components and the supernatant fluid in cellular components, reduced to a minimum.. according to the aabb circular of information for the use of human blood components (revised 2017), febrile nonhemolytic reactions are typically manifested by a temperature elevation of >1c or 2f occurring during or within 4 hours after a transfusion and in the absence of any other pyrexic stimulus or active warming. febrile reactions may occur in less than 1% of transfusion of leukocyte-reduced red cell components and about 5% of leukocyte-reduced apheresis platelet components. febrile reactions occur more frequently in patients receiving non-leukocyte-reduced components and those previously alloimmunized by transfusion or pregnancy. antipyretics usually provide effective symptomatic relief. patients who experience repeated, severe febrile reactions may benefit from receiving leukocyte-reduced components. if these reactions are caused by cytokines in the component, prestorage leukocyte reduction may be beneficial. investigation is in process, a follow-up report will be provided..investigation: no deaths were

a tertiary hospital during the covid-19 pandemic enabling cold-stored platelets (37% plasma/63% pas iiim, trima, terumo bct) for treatment of actively bleeding patients from 17 march, 2020, to 31 december, 2021, the lot numbers were not provided; therefore, a disposable lot history search could not be conducted. as the covid-19 pandemic led to a national lockdown in norway on 12 march, 2020, we knew little about how this would affect the demand and availability of blood products. we anticipated that donor availability would decline but did not know whether blood demand would increase or decline as the pandemic progressed. in platelet concentrates (pcs), with a short shelf life of only seven days in norway, would be the first blood component affected by reduced collections or increased transfusions. to increase preparedness without increasing number of collections we decided to introduce cold stored platelets (csp) with 14-days shelf life for actively bleeding patients. this decision was based on results from previous laboratory and clinical studies performed by our department.1,2 in our laboratory study we found that in vitro assays measuring hemostasis and aggregation show csp on day 14 to be comparable to room temperature-stored platelets (rtp) on day 7.1 further, the results from our study of cold-stored platelet transfusions for patients with complex cardiothoracic surgery showed that csp is able to reduce and stop bleeding, also after storage for up to 14 days.2 our results are in accordance with several international laboratory studies, which have shown preserved platelet function during extended cold storage.1,3¿7 additionally, the risk of bacterial growth in csp is low and platelet aggregation response is better preserved in csp to rtp. from 17 march, 2020, the department of immunology and transfusion medicine at haukeland university hospital collected and produced csp units from apheresis (37% plasma/63% pas iiim, trima, terumo bct) from donors with blood type o or a. after two hours rest at room temperature, units for cold storage were labeled as cold-stored with 14 days shelf life. quality control of the pcs was performed according to routine procedures. we aseptically removed samples for bacterial testing (bact/alert fa plus, bio-mérieux sa) on day 1 and incubated the samples for 13.5 days (bact/alert 3d, bio-mérieux sa). the csp units were stored under continuous temperature monitoring without agitation at 2°c¿6°c for a maximum of 14 days. only pcs without aggregates were used and the units were stored cold from the day of collection. the majority of our apheresis pcs had aggregates after two hours rest. this often led to unnecessary donations of apheresis pc for cold storage when room temperature storage was sufficient. to simplify logistics without reducing quality or shelf life, we changed our procedure from 12 november 2020, to include pcs in which aggregates dissolved after agitation at room temperature to be transferred to cold storage one day after collection with 14 days shelf life.5,26 all patients receiving csp units were included in our patient quality registry. the following information was collected and registered in the database: age, gender, blood type, and ward for each patient, the indication for transfusion as well as blood usage and transfusion reactions for each transfusion episode, which was defined as 24 h following the first csp transfusion. additionally, platelet count (plt) and hemoglobin (hbg) before and within 24 h after each transfusion episode were registered if analyzed. from 17 march, 2020, to 31 december, 2021, a total of 5147 pc units were produced of which 276 (5%) were csp units. in total, 186 csp units (3.6%) were transfused to 92 patients in 103 transfusion episodes (table 1). median storage time of csp units at issue was six days (3¿9, 0¿14). patient characteristics are described in table 1. the main indication for csp transfusion was surgical bleeding (figure 3). a total of 81 (88%) patients had surgical bleeding, and most of these patients underwent cardiovascular surgery. csp units. the proportion of csp transfusions when compared to the total number of pc transfusions in the department of cardiovascular surgery also changed after this. during the 20 weeks leading up to the change in procedure, 14 of 134 pcs (10%) were csp while 31 of 173 (18%) were csp during the 20 weeks following the change. only four of the 186 (2%) issued csp units were transfused to patients without bleeding. two patients received csp in an emergency order or when admitted to the emergency ward but were not actively bleeding. the third patient, admitted to the postoperative thoracic surgery ward, received two prophylactic csp units before the procedure. none of these patients required immediate transfusions of additional platelets. of the 92 patients, 86 (93%) received additional blood components and/or whole blood and 22 (24%) also received rtp units (table s1). all patients (100%) survived after one hour and 88 (96%) survived 24 h after the first transfusion. no deaths were associated with transfusion of csp units. two of the patients who did not survive were on venous¿arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo), one had post-operative complications after a fifth ileus operation and the fourth patient had an untreatable cancer <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b>. no transfusion reactions were attributed to csp units. however, a young patient with postoperative bleeding developed transfusion-associated lung injury (trali) with symptoms starting after an emergency transfusion with two units of packed red cells. this patient underwent an emergency reoperation shortly after where he received additional transfusions of three units of packed red cells, two units of plasma, and one unit of csp. a postoperative chest radiography demonstrated bilateral opacities of the lungs. the attending anesthesiologist suspected trali which was confirmed by the immunohematology senior consultant. however, since silent hypoxia started before the transfusion of csp, they were not considered the cause of the transfusion reaction. during the study period, our department documented ten transfusion reactions to room temperature stored pcs, five mild allergic reactions, three transfusion associated circulatory overload (taco) reactions, one febrile reaction, and one anaphylactic reaction. for the patients with active bleeding there was a reduction in mean plt and hbg measured before and within 24 h after issue of the first csp unit (table 2). teg 6s global hemostasis assay was ordered for a total of 30 patients, 18 before transfusion and 22 after transfusion (table s2). results from the ten patients with analysis both before and after csp transfusions are displayed in table 3. the results show an improved hemostasis and aggregation ability after transfusion of csp. for these ten patients mean plt declined from 121 x 109/l (56, 187, 5¿280) to 115 x 109/l (75, 155, 5¿201) after transfusion of csp, while hgb increased from 9.2 g/dl (7.9, 10.6, 5.6¿11.8) to 9.4 g/dl (8.4, 10.4, 8.0¿13.1). blood loss measured as chest drain output until 08:00 am the next morning was measured for the 65 patients who had thoracic drains post-operatively. there was a median blood loss of 800 ml (480¿1570, 180¿ 10,810). plt declined similarly for these 65 patients from mean 187 x 109/l (168, 206, 31¿394) pre-operatively to 127 x 109/l (114, 140, 44¿290) post-operatively while hgb declined from 10.0 g/dl (9.4, 10.5, 5.6¿16.1) to 9.4 g/dl (9.1, 9.6, 7.6¿11.4). the patients in this quality database received transfusions due to active bleeding, where platelets are needed to form clots and thereby stop bleeding. additionally, the majority of patients who underwent surgery are expected to have a fluid overload post-operatively compared to pre-operatively. this can explain the reduced plt and hgb at the end of the transfusion episode. teg 6s global hemostasis assay is the only clinical measurement of hemostasis in the quality registry, and shows improved platelet aggregation despite a reduction in plt. this is consistent with laboratory studies finding csp to have better aggregation response compared to rtp.1,8¿10 the lack of reported transfusion reactions is in accordance with what we see for all types of blood components in patients undergoing surgery. it is not fully understood if there is a reduced risk of transfusion reactions during surgery or if there is an underreporting of events due to reactions being construed as a normal symptom post-operatively. our previous clinical trial did not show any difference in transfusion reactions or thromboembolic events in the csp groups compared to the room temperature-stored platelets (rtp) group.2 a 24-h survival of 95.5% may at first glance seem low, however, all four patients that did not survive were high-risk patients where transfusion did not appear to affect the outcome. discussion: csp with 14-days shelf life is a feasible alternative for the treatment of patients with bleeding. implementation of a dual platelet inventory requires thorough planning, including information and training of clinical and laboratory staff, continuous follow-up of practice and patients, and an easy-to follow <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> for use of csp units. a dual platelet inventory may mitigate the risk of platelet shortage during a pandemic situation. root cause: a definitive root cause of the trali could not be determined. possible reasons for trali include various stimuli in blood components, most commonly white blood cell (wbc) antibodies from donors sensitized during pregnancy or prior transfusion or transplantation or proinflammatory molecules that accumulate in stored blood components. these mechanisms may not be mutually exclusive and may act synergistically with underlying patient factors to lead to a final common pathway of acute lung injury. these stimuli may trigger an inflammatory response, granulocyte activation and degranulation, and injury to the alveolar capillary membrane and the development of permeability pulmonary edema. although most trali cases are associated with donor antileukocyte antibodies, rare cases have implicated recipient antileukocyte antibodies that reacted with donor leukocytes. a definitive root cause of the allergic reactions could not be determined. possible reasons for reactions related to transfusion of platelet concentrates include (i) ige and igg antibodies in the recipient against plasma proteins in the transfused blood component, (ii) transfusion of cytokines, chemokines, and histamine generated in the platelet product during preparation and storage. the best-known type of anaphylactic reaction is induced by iga deficiency of the recipient and subsequent formation of anti-iga. patients lacking only one iga subclass may form subclass-specific anti-iga; other patients may get immunized against allotypes on the iga molecules. patients with such antibodies of ¿limited specificity¿ usually experience less severe anaphylactic reactions than patients with complete iga deficiency and class-specific anti-iga. a definitive root cause of the taco could not be determined. transfusion-associated circulatory overload (taco) is a frequent complication of transfusion leading to cardiogenic (hydrostatic) pulmonary edema and can occur after transfusion of excessive volumes or at excessively rapid rates. this is a particular risk in individuals with underlying cardiopulmonary or renal disease, the very young and the elderly, and in patients with chronic severe anemia in who low red cells mass is associated with high plasma volume. small transfusion volumes can precipitate symptoms in at-risk patients who already have a positive fluid balance. a root cause assessment was performed for the febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction. the reported adverse events are common side effects of transfusion. based on the available information a definitive root cause could not be determined but it is likely due to one or a combination of the possible causes listed below: * the action of antibodies against white cells or the action of cytokines either present in the transfused component or generated by the recipient in response to transfused elements. * patients received non-leukocyte-reduced cohgbmponents. * patients were previously alloimunized by transfusion or pregnancy. a root cause assessment was performed for the reduction in platelet count and hemoglobin. according to the authors, "the patients in this quality database received transfusions due to active bleeding, where platelets are needed to form clots and thereby stop bleeding. additionally, the majority of patients who underwent surgery are expected to have a fluid overload post-operatively compared to pre-operatively. this can explain the reduced plt and hgb at the end of the transfusion episode."</p><hr><h3 id="ALG-DIAG-032">Result ALG-DIAG-032</h3><p><a

event details has been received since the previous medwatch report was sent..reference: (b)(6). the current study enrolled all patients treated for elective evar by the sp zenith flex stent graft (cook medical, (b)(6). ) between march 2010 and november 2011 and patients treated for elective evar by the zenith lp stent graft (cook medical) between november 2011 and march 2013. all patients had a follow-up >18 months. preoperative computed tomography angiograms were analyzed on a dedicated three-dimensional workstation. all data were prospectively collected in an electronic database and retrospectively analyzed. a comparative study was conducted. methods: all patients treated for elective infrarenal aortic or common iliac aneurysms using evar at our institution between march 2010 and april 2013 were included in this retrospective study. all custom-made devices, including fenestrated or branched aortic stent grafts, were excluded. the medical records and images from a prospectively collected database were analyzed retrospectively. all patients gave their informed consent to be included in the present study, which was approved by our local ethics committee. two groups of patients were identified: the sp group included all patients treated between march 2010 and november 2011 with a combination of sp (18f to 22f) aaa stent grafts comprising a zenith flex (cook medical,(b)(6). ) bifurcated main body graft (tffb) and iliac legs (tfle). the lp group included all patients treated between november 2011 and april 2013 with a combination of lp (16f) aaa stent graft comprising a zenith lp (cook medical) main bifurcated body (zalb) and spiral-z iliac legs (zsle). these devices are currently available in europe but not in the united states. all computed tomography angiograms were analyzed on a dedicated imaging workstation by two endovascular therapists ( (b)(6).) trained in planning and sizing of standard and complex evar cases. we evaluated the computed tomography angiographies (ctas) according to ghatwary et al. a centerline of flow reconstruction using a semiautomated centerline <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> was generated to assess aortic and iliac morphologies. the following anatomical criteria were collected as described by the society for vascular surgery reporting standards aortic/iliac diameters and lengths at the level of the proximal and the distal sealing zones, maximum aortic diameter of the aneurysm and diameter of the aortoiliac bifurcation, tortuosity index of the iliac axis by applying a ratio of the distance depicted using the centerline of flow between the aortoiliac bifurcation and the iliofemoral junction to the distance of a straight-line between those two points (modified method recently described by (b)(6) et al). and presence of long (>1 cm) circumferential calcification with significant stenosis >50% of the iliac artery. calcification and stenosis as defined previously were defined as ¿hostile¿ arteries. the quality of the proximal and distal sealing zones related to the presence of arterial wall thrombus or calcifications, or both, were also assessed. for each group of patients, the preoperative aortoiliac anatomy was assessed in accordance with the ifu criteria for evar, based on european guidelines. patients¿ characteristics and surgical data were collected (tables i and ii). postoperative events, including complications and subsequent reinterventions, during follow-up were collected. the freedom from late reintervention and patient overall survival curves at 1 and 2 years were calculated for each group according to the kaplan-meier method; a log-rank test was applied to compare both cohorts. at the time of this study, cta was routinely performed before hospital discharge. patients with poor renal function (postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate clearance of <45 ml/min/1.73 m2) had a contrast-free ct and a contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination. post discharge follow-up included an ultrasound examination at 6 months and cta at 12 months. both examinations were repeated annually. a maximal aortic diameter enlargement or shrinkage >5 mm was considered significant. statistics: statistical analysis was performed using software and graphs were drawn with software. categoric and continuous variables were collected for all patients in the study. continuous variables are expressed as median and interquartile ranges (iqrs) or mean and standard error of the mean, and categoric variables as percentage. the fisher exact x 2 tests were used to study significant differences between the group sp and group lp patients for categoric variables. a p value of<.05 was considered to determine significant differences. kaplan-meier survival curves are presented and compared using log-rank tests for testing significant differences between survival curves. a predictive model was developed to demonstrate any correlation between preoperative characteristics with a composite outcome of death less than or equal to 24 months, reintervention or endoleak, and other defined complications. a binary variable representing this composite outcome measure was modeled. inclusion of variables in the model with p less than or equal to 0.2 were based on the fisher exact test for categoric variables and univariate logistic regressions for continuous variables. a multivariate logistic regression model with backward selection was fitted. results: the study included 208 patients, with 107 patients in the sp group and 101 in the lp group. preoperative characteristics were comparable (table i). preoperative cta analysis found no differences in aortic morphology. significant differences were found when iliac morphology was compared, with patients in the lp group having more challenging iliac anatomies compared with the sp patients. the diameter of the external iliac arteries was significantly different (table iii). significant differences were quantified when comparing the proportion of patients with minimal external iliac diameters of both external iliac arteries <7 mm (6.9% in group sp vs 22.2% in group lp; p=.0023). significant differences were demonstrated between the groups in the proportion of patients with an iliac tortuosity index ratio >1.5 (7 in group sp vs 22 in group lp; p = .002), or bilateral significant iliac angulation of external iliac arteries (16 in group sp vs 33 in group lp; p = .003). the median iliac tortuosity index ratio in both cohorts was similar (p = .173 for both; p = .332 for the left side and p = .341 for the right side); in the sp group, this was 1.3 (iqr, 1.2-1.4; mean, 1.35 plus/minus 0.19) for the left and 1.3 (iqr, 1.2-1.4; mean, 1.34 plus/minus 0.19) for the right side (p = .611), and in the lp group was 1.4 (iqr, 1.2-1.5; mean, 1.38 plus/minus 0.19) for the left and 1.3 (iqr, 1.2-1.5; mean, 1.36 plus/minus 0.19) for the right side (p = .613). technical success rate was similar in both groups (97% in group sp vs 99% in group lp; p = .622). respectively, 30% and 31% of patients in the sp and lp groups (p= .612) underwent full percutaneous procedure. no differences in access-related postoperative complications were found (4 patients in the sp group and 0 in the lp group; p = .122). the number of supplementary procedures performed during the initial intervention was higher in the sp group than in the lp group, but the difference was not statistically significant (p ¼ .205; table iv). none were planned preoperatively and were all due to intraoperative findings. the median follow-up was 45 (iqr, 39-55) months for the sp group and 24 (iqr, 19-29) months for the lp group (p < .0001). the postoperative course was similar in both groups. no 30-day deaths were recorded in either group. freedom from reintervention (fig 1) and overall patient survival (fig 2) were similar at 1 and 2 years (log-rank test p= .183 and p= .86, respectively). the 2-year rate for freedom from limb occlusion was similar in both groups, 92% in sp and 95% in lp (p=.293). no stent fractures and no stent graft migrations were reported during the study period. late reinterventions are reported table v. both groups had a similar number of endoleaks during the follow-up (table vi). no aaa ruptures happened during the study period. one patient in each group required an aortic stent graft explantation during follow-up; the patient in the sp group underwent explantation 2.5 years after the index procedure for a persistent proximal type i endoleak, and the stent graft was removed in a lp group patient due to stent graft thrombosis. in a multivariate logistic regression model, the main predictor of postoperative events (composite criteria) was a left external iliac artery diameter <7 mm with an odds ratio of 1.753 (95% confidence interval [ci], 1.314- 2.338; p= .0001). patients with a bilateral iliac diameter <7 mm had a point estimate of 4.854 (95% ci, 1.484-15.973; p = .009; table vii). the focus of this report are the three patients who received late postoperative reinterventions (greater than 30 days post operative) due to limb

devices (march 2010 and november 2011) and zenith low profile devices (november 2011 and march 2013). the results were published in the journal of vascular surgery article ¿evaluation of the zenith low-profile abdominal aortic aneurysm stent graft.¿ the focus of this report are the three patients who received late postoperative reinterventions (greater than 30 days post operative) due to limb stenosis/kink/occlusion for the standard profile (zsle) iliac leg grafts. reference: sobocinski, j., briffa, f., holt, p. j., martin gonzalez, t., spear, r., azzaoui, r., maurel, b., & haulon, s. (2015). evaluation of the zenith low-profile abdominal aortic aneurysm stent graft. journal of vascular surgery, 62(4), 841¿847. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2015.04.452 reviews of documentation including the complaint history, drawing, quality control, specifications, manufacturing instructions (mi), and instructions for use (ifu), were conducted during the investigation. the complaint device was not returned; therefore, no physical examinations could be performed. no medical imaging was provided for review. additionally, a document-based investigation evaluation was performed. a review of the device master record (dmr) concluded that sufficient inspection activities are in place to identify this failure mode prior to distribution. a review of the device history record (dhr) was unable to be completed due to a lack of lot information. based on the available information, cook has concluded that the device was manufactured to specification and that there is no evidence suggesting nonconforming product exists either in house or in field. cook also reviewed product labeling. the ifu packaged with the device contains the following in relation to the reported failure mode ¿4 warnings and precautions 4.1 general ¿ additional endovascular interventions or conversion to standard open surgical repair following initial endovascular repair should be considered for patients experiencing enlarging aneurysms, unacceptable decrease in fixation length (vessel and component overlap) and/or endoleak. an increase in aneurysm size and/or persistent endoleak or migration may lead to aneurysm rupture. ¿ patients experiencing reduced blood flow through the graft limb and/or leaks may be required to undergo secondary interventions or surgical procedures. 4.2 patient selection, treatment and follow-up ¿ zenith spiral-z iliac artery distal fixation site greater than 10 mm in length and 7.5-20 mm in diameter (measured outer wall to outer wall) is required. these sizing measurements are critical to the performance of the endovascular repair. ¿ adequate iliac or femoral access is required to introduce the device into the vasculature. access vessel diameter (measured inner wall to inner wall) and morphology (minimal tortuosity, occlusive disease and/or calcification) should be compatible with vascular access techniques and delivery systems of a 14 french to 16 french vascular introducer sheath. vessels that are significantly calcified, occlusive, tortuous, or thrombus-lined may preclude placement of the endovascular graft and/or may increase the risk of embolization. a vascular conduit technique may be necessary to achieve success in some patients. ¿ pre-existing regions of stenosis/narrowing (less than approximately 20 mm id in the aorta or 7 to 8 mm id in the iliacs) have been shown to increase the risk of a thromboembolic event (e.g., graft limb occlusion). the potential for this increased risk in these patients may preclude placement of an endovascular graft. dilatation of these regions with a noncompliant balloon and/or stent placement may be necessary to help assure maintained graft patency and to reduce the risk of a thromboembolic event. additionally, the completion angiogram (with stiff wire guides removed) should be reviewed carefully to determine if further treatment in these regions is necessary (e.g., adjunctive ballooning or stenting). failure to remove the stiff wire guide prior to the angiogram could mask any limb kinking or narrowing that might occur when the wire guide is removed. ¿ follow-up imaging should be carefully reviewed for narrowing within the graft leg. patients with a graft leg lumen of less than approximately 5 mm id may be at increased risk of a thromboembolic event (e.g., graft limb occlusion). reintervention (e.g., noncompliant ballooning or stenting in these regions) should be considered to help assure maintained graft patency and to reduce the risk of a thromboembolic event. ¿ patients with poor outflow or a hypercoagulable state (e.g., cancer) may be at an increased risk of a thromboembolic event. ¿ successfully patient selection requires specific imaging and accurate measurements; please see section 4.3, pre-procedure measurement techniques and imaging. 4.3 pre-procedure measurement techniques and imaging ¿ clinical experience indicates that contrast-enhanced spiral computed tomographic angiography (cta) with 3-d reconstruction is the strongly recommended imaging modality to accurately assess patient anatomy prior to treatment with the zenith spiral-z aaa iliac leg. if contrast-enhanced spiral cta with 3-d reconstruction is not available, the patient should be referred to a facility with these capabilities. lengths ¿ all patients should be advised that endovascular treatment requires life-long, regular follow-up to assess their health and the performance of their endovascular graft. patients with specific clinical findings (e.g., endoleaks, enlarging aneurysm or changes in the structure or position of the endovascular graft) should receive enhanced follow-up. specific follow-up guidelines are described in section 12, imaging guidelines and postoperative follow-up. ¿ after endovascular graft placement, patients should be regularly monitored for perigraft flow, aneurysm growth or changes in the structure or position of the endovascular graft. at a minimum, annual imaging is required, including: 1) abdominal radiographs to examine device integrity (separation between components or stent fracture) and 2) contrast and non-contrast ct to examine aneurysm changes, perigraft flow, patency, tortuosity, and progressive disease. if renal complications or other factors preclude the use of image contrast media, abdominal radiographs and duplex ultrasound may provide similar information. 4.5 implant procedure ¿ do not continue advancing any portion of the delivery system if resistance is felt during advancement of the wire guide or delivery system. stop and assess the cause of resistance; vessel, catheter or graft damage may occur. exercise particular care in areas of stenosis, intravascular thrombosis, or in calcified or tortuous vessels. ¿ inaccurate placement and/or incomplete sealing of the zenith spiral-z aaa iliac leg within the vessel may result in increased risk of endoleak, migration or inadvertent occlusion of the internal iliac arteries. ¿ fluoroscopy should be used during introduction and deployment to confirm proper operation of the delivery system components, proper placement of the graft, and desired procedural outcome. ¿ excessive overlap 10 mm above the main body bifurcation may increase the risk of limb thrombosis. 5.2 potential adverse events ¿ claudication (e.g., buttock, lower limb) ¿ endoprosthesis: improper component placement;

a log-rank test was applied to compare both cohorts. at the time of this study, cta was routinely performed before hospital discharge. patients with poor renal function (postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate clearance of <45 ml/min/1.73 m2) had a contrast-free ct and a contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination. post discharge follow-up included an ultrasound examination at 6 months and cta at 12 months. both examinations were repeated annually. a maximal aortic diameter enlargement or shrinkage >5 mm was considered significant. statistics: statistical analysis was performed using software and graphs were drawn with software. categoric and continuous variables were collected for all patients in the study. continuous variables are expressed as median and interquartile ranges (iqrs) or mean and standard error of the mean, and categoric variables as percentage. the fisher exact x 2 tests were used to study significant differences between the group sp and group lp patients for categoric variables. a p value of<.05 was considered to determine significant differences. kaplan-meier survival curves are presented and compared using log-rank tests for testing significant differences between survival curves. a predictive model was developed to demonstrate any correlation between preoperative characteristics with a composite outcome of death less than or equal to 24 months, reintervention or endoleak, and other defined complications. a binary variable representing this composite outcome measure was modeled. inclusion of variables in the model with p less than or equal to 0.2 were based on the fisher exact test for categoric variables and univariate logistic regressions for continuous variables. a multivariate logistic regression model with backward selection was fitted. results: the study included 208 patients, with 107 patients in the sp group and 101 in the lp group. preoperative characteristics were comparable (table i). preoperative cta analysis found no differences in aortic morphology. significant differences were found when iliac morphology was compared, with patients in the lp group having more challenging iliac anatomies compared with the sp patients. the diameter of the external iliac arteries was significantly different (table iii). significant differences were quantified when comparing the proportion of patients with minimal external iliac diameters of both external iliac arteries <7 mm (6.9% in group sp vs 22.2% in group lp; p=.0023). significant differences were demonstrated between the groups in the proportion of patients with an iliac tortuosity index ratio >1.5 (7 in group sp vs 22 in group lp; p = .002), or bilateral significant iliac angulation of external iliac arteries (16 in group sp vs 33 in group lp; p = .003). the median iliac tortuosity index ratio in both cohorts was similar (p = .173 for both; p = .332 for the left side and p = .341 for the right side); in the sp group, this was 1.3 (iqr, 1.2-1.4; mean, 1.35 plus/minus 0.19) for the left and 1.3 (iqr, 1.2-1.4; mean, 1.34 plus/minus 0.19) for the right side (p = .611), and in the lp group was 1.4 (iqr, 1.2-1.5; mean, 1.38 plus/minus 0.19) for the left and 1.3 (iqr, 1.2-1.5; mean, 1.36 plus/minus 0.19) for the right side (p = .613). technical success rate was similar in both groups (97% in group sp vs 99% in group lp; p = .622). respectively, 30% and 31% of patients in the sp and lp groups (p= .612) underwent full percutaneous procedure. no differences in access-related postoperative complications were found (4 patients in the sp group and 0 in the lp group; p = .122). the number of supplementary procedures performed during the initial intervention was higher in the sp group than in the lp group, but the difference was not statistically significant (p ¼ .205; table iv). none were planned preoperatively and were all due to intraoperative findings. the median follow-up was 45 (iqr, 39-55) months for the sp group and 24 (iqr, 19-29) months for the lp group (p < .0001). the postoperative course was similar in both groups. no 30-day deaths were recorded in either group. freedom from reintervention (fig 1) and overall patient survival (fig 2) were similar at 1 and 2 years (log-rank test p= .183 and p= .86, respectively). the 2-year rate for freedom from limb occlusion was similar in both groups, 92% in sp and 95% in lp (p=.293). no stent fractures and no stent graft migrations were reported during the study period. late reinterventions are reported table v. both groups had a similar number of endoleaks during the follow-up (table vi). no aaa ruptures happened during the study period. one patient in each group required an aortic stent graft explantation during follow-up; the patient in the sp group underwent explantation 2.5 years after the index procedure for a persistent proximal type i endoleak, and the stent graft was removed in a lp group patient due to stent graft thrombosis. in a multivariate logistic regression model, the main predictor of postoperative events (composite criteria) was a left external iliac artery diameter <7 mm with an odds ratio of 1.753 (95% confidence interval [ci], 1.314- 2.338; p= .0001). patients with a bilateral iliac diameter <7 mm had a point estimate of 4.854 (95% ci, 1.484-15.973; p = .009; table vii). the focus of this report is the patient who required late postoperative intervention (greater than 30 days) due to a graft thrombosis in the low profile zsle iliac leg graft. the graft was explanted during the reintervention. additional reports originating from this journal article will be submitted under the manufacturer reference numbers: 410763, 410767, 410770, 410771.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:blank fields on this form indicate the information is unknown, unavailable, or unchanged. investigation-evaluation: a retrospective study was completed for patients who were treated by elective endovascular aortic repair (evar) using the zenith flex devices (march 2010 and november 2011) and zenith low profile devices (november 2011 and march 2013). the results were published in the journal of vascular surgery article ¿evaluation of the zenith low-profile abdominal aortic aneurysm stent graft.¿ the focus of this report is the patient who required an explant of the standard profile (zsle) iliac leg graft(s). this event is captured in the article as a late postoperative reinterventions (greater than 30 days post operative). reference: sobocinski, j., briffa, f., holt, p. j., martin gonzalez, t., spear, r., azzaoui, r., maurel, b., & haulon, s. (2015). evaluation of the zenith low-profile abdominal aortic aneurysm stent graft. journal of vascular surgery, 62(4), 841¿847. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2015.04.452 reviews of documentation including the complaint history, drawing, quality control, specifications, manufacturing instructions (mi), and instructions for use (ifu) were conducted during the investigation. the complaint device was not returned; therefore, no physical examinations could be performed. no medical imaging was provided for review. additionally, a document-based investigation evaluation was performed. a review of the device master record (dmr) concluded that sufficient inspection activities are in place to identify this failure mode prior to distribution. a review of the device history record (dhr) was unable to be completed due to a lack of lot information. based on the available information, cook has concluded that the device was manufactured to specification and that there is no evidence suggesting nonconforming product exists either in house or in field. cook also reviewed product labeling. the ifu packaged with the device contains the following in relation to the reported failure mode ¿4 warnings and precautions: 4.1 general: ¿ additional endovascular interventions or conversion to standard open surgical repair following initial endovascular repair should be considered for patients experiencing enlarging aneurysms, unacceptable decrease in fixation length (vessel and component overlap) and/or endoleak. an increase in aneurysm size and/or persistent endoleak or migration may lead to aneurysm rupture. ¿ patients experiencing reduced blood flow through the graft limb and/or leaks may be required to undergo secondary interventions or surgical procedures. 4.2 patient selection, treatment and follow-up ¿ zenith spiral-z iliac artery distal fixation site greater than 10 mm in length and 7.5-20 mm in diameter (measured outer wall to outer wall) is required. these sizing measurements are critical to the performance of the endovascular repair. ¿ adequate iliac or femoral access is required to introduce the device into the vasculature. access vessel diameter (measured inner wall to inner wall) and morphology (minimal tortuosity, occlusive disease and/or calcification) should be compatible with vascular access techniques and delivery systems of a 14 french to 16 french vascular introducer sheath. vessels that are significantly calcified, occlusive, tortuous, or thrombus-lined may preclude placement of the endovascular graft and/or may increase the risk of embolization. a vascular conduit technique may be necessary to achieve success in some patients. ¿ pre-existing regions of stenosis/narrowing (less than approximately 20 mm id in the aorta or 7 to 8 mm id in the iliacs) have been shown to increase the risk of a thromboembolic event (e.g., graft limb occlusion). the potential for this increased risk in these patients may preclude placement of an endovascular graft. dilatation of these regions with a noncompliant balloon and/or stent placement may be necessary to help assure maintained graft patency and to reduce the risk of a thromboembolic event. additionally, the completion angiogram (with stiff wire guides removed) should be reviewed carefully to determine if further treatment in these regions is necessary (e.g., adjunctive ballooning or stenting). failure to remove the stiff wire guide prior to the angiogram could mask any limb kinking or narrowing that might occur when the wire guide is removed. ¿ follow-up imaging should be carefully reviewed for narrowing within the graft leg. patients with a graft leg lumen of less than approximately 5 mm id may be at increased risk of a thromboembolic event (e.g., graft limb occlusion). reintervention (e.g., noncompliant ballooning or stenting in these regions) should be considered to help assure maintained graft patency and to reduce the risk of a thromboembolic event. ¿ patients with poor outflow or a hypercoagulable state (e.g., cancer) may be at an increased risk of a thromboembolic event. ¿ successfully patient selection requires specific imaging and accurate measurements; please see section 4.3, pre-procedure measurement techniques and imaging. 4.3 pre-procedure measurement techniques and imaging ¿ clinical experience indicates that contrast-enhanced spiral computed tomographic angiography (cta) with 3-d reconstruction is the strongly recommended imaging modality to accurately assess patient anatomy prior to treatment with the zenith spiral-z aaa iliac leg. if contrast-enhanced spiral cta with 3-d reconstruction is not available, the patient should be referred to a facility with these capabilities. lengths ¿ all patients should be advised that endovascular treatment requires life-long, regular follow-up to assess their health and the performance of their endovascular graft. patients with specific clinical findings (e.g., endoleaks, enlarging aneurysm or changes in the structure or position of the endovascular graft) should receive enhanced follow-up. specific follow-up guidelines are described in section 12, imaging guidelines and postoperative follow-up. ¿ after endovascular graft placement, patients should be regularly monitored for perigraft flow, aneurysm growth or changes in the structure or position of the endovascular graft. at a minimum, annual imaging is required, including: 1) abdominal radiographs to examine device integrity (separation between components or stent fracture) and 2) contrast and non-contrast ct to examine aneurysm changes, perigraft flow, patency, tortuosity, and progressive disease. if renal complications or other factors preclude the use of image contrast media, abdominal radiographs and duplex ultrasound may provide similar information. 4.5 implant procedure: ¿ do not continue advancing any portion of the delivery system if resistance is felt during advancement of the wire guide or delivery system. stop and assess the cause of resistance; vessel, catheter or graft damage may occur. exercise particular care in areas of stenosis, intravascular thrombosis, or in calcified or tortuous vessels. ¿ inaccurate placement and/or incomplete sealing of the zenith spiral-z aaa iliac leg within the vessel may result in increased risk of endoleak, migration or inadvertent occlusion of the internal iliac arteries. ¿ fluoroscopy should be used during introduction and deployment to confirm proper operation of the delivery system components, proper placement of the graft, and desired procedural outcome. ¿ excessive overlap 10 mm above the main body bifurcation may increase the risk of limb thrombosis. 5.2 potential adverse events: ¿ claudication (e.g., buttock, lower limb). ¿ endoprosthesis: improper component placement; incomplete component deployment; component migration; component separation from another graft component; suture break; occlusion; infection; stent fracture; graft material wear; dilatation; erosion; puncture; perigraft flow; and corrosion. ¿ graft or native vessel occlusion. ¿ surgical conversion to open repair. 7.1 individualization of treatment: additional considerations for patient selection include, but are not limited to: ¿ patient¿s age and life expectancy. ¿ co-morbidities (e.g., cardiac, pulmonary, or renal insufficiency prior to surgery, morbid obesity). ¿ patient¿s suitability for open surgical repair. ¿ patient¿s anatomical suitability for endovascular repair. ¿ patient¿s ability to tolerate general, regional, or local anesthesia. ¿ iliofemoral access vessel size and morphology (minimal thrombus, calcification and/or tortuosity) should be compatible with vascular access techniques and accessories of the delivery profile of a 14 french to 16 french vascular introducer sheath. ¿ freedom from significant femoral/iliac artery occlusive disease that would impede flow through the endovascular graft. 8 patient counseling information: ¿ all patients should be advised that endovascular treatment requires life-long, regular follow-up to assess their health and the performance of their endovascular graft. patients with specific clinical findings (e.g., endoleaks, enlarging aneurysms or changes in the structure or position of the endovascular graft) should receive enhanced follow-up. specific follow-up guidelines are described in section 12, imaging guidelines and postoperative follow-up. ¿ patients should be counseled on the importance of adhering to the follow-up schedule, both during the first year and at yearly intervals thereafter. patients should be told that regular and consistent follow-up is a critical part of ensuring the ongoing safety and effectiveness of endovascular treatment of aaas. at a minimum, annual imaging and adherence to routine postoperative follow-up requirements is required and should be considered a life-long commitment to the patient¿s health and well-being. ¿ physicians must advise all patients that it is important to seek prompt medical attention if they experience signs of limb occlusion, aneurysm enlargement or rupture. signs of graft limb occlusion include pain in the hip(s) or leg(s) during walking or at rest or discoloration or coolness of the leg. aneurysm rupture may be asymptomatic, but usually presents as: pain; numbness; weakness in the legs; any back, chest, abdominal or groin pain; dizziness; fainting; rapid heartbeat or sudden weakness. physicians should refer patients to the patient guide regarding risks occurring during or after implantation of the device. procedure-related risks include cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, bowel and bleeding complications. device-related risks include occlusion, endoleak, aneurysm enlargement, fracture, potential for reintervention and open surgical conversion, rupture, and death (see section 5.1, observed adverse events and section 5.2, potential adverse events). the physician should complete the patient i.d. card and give it to the patient so that he/she can carry it with him/her at all times. the patient should refer to the card anytime he/she visits additional health practitioners, particularly for any additional <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> procedures (e.g., mri). 12 imaging guidelines and postoperative follow-up: 12.1 general: ¿ all patients should be advised that endovascular treatment requires lifelong, regular follow-up to assess their health and the performance of their endovascular graft. patients with specific clinical findings (e.g., endoleaks, enlarging aneurysms or changes in the structure or position of the endovascular graft) should receive additional follow-up. ¿ patients should be counseled on the importance of adhering to the follow-up schedule, both during the first year and at yearly intervals thereafter. patients should be told that regular and consistent follow-up is a critical part of ensuring the ongoing safety and effectiveness of endovascular treatment of aaas. ¿ physicians should evaluate patients on an individual basis and prescribe follow-up relative to the needs and circumstances of each individual patient. the minimum requirement for patient follow-up (described in the instructions for use for the zenith aaa device that was used) should be maintained even in the absence of clinical symptoms (e.g., pain, numbness, weakness). patients with specific clinical findings (e.g., pain, numbness, weakness). patients with specific clinical findings (e.g., endoleaks, enlarging aneurysms or changes in the structure or position of the stent graft) should receive follow-up at more frequent intervals. ¿ the combination of contrast and non-contrast ct imaging provides information on aneurysm diameter change, endoleak, patency, tortuosity, progressive disease, fixation length and other morphological changes. ¿ duplex ultrasound imaging may provide information on aneurysm diameter change, endoleak, patency, tortuosity, and progressive disease. in this circumstance, a non-contrast ct should be performed to use in conjunction with the ultrasound. ultrasound may be a less reliable and sensitive <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> method compared to ct. based on the information provided, no product returned, and the results of the investigation a definitive

and categoric variables as percentage. the fisher exact x 2 tests were used to study significant differences between the group sp and group lp patients for categoric variables. a p value of<.05 was considered to determine significant differences. kaplan-meier survival curves are presented and compared using log-rank tests for testing significant differences between survival curves. a predictive model was developed to demonstrate any correlation between preoperative characteristics with a composite outcome of death less than or equal to 24 months, reintervention or endoleak, and other defined complications. a binary variable representing this composite outcome measure was modeled. inclusion of variables in the model with p less than or equal to 0.2 were based on the fisher exact test for categoric variables and univariate logistic regressions for continuous variables. a multivariate logistic regression model with backward selection was fitted. results: the study included 208 patients, with 107 patients in the sp group and 101 in the lp group. preoperative characteristics were comparable (table i). preoperative cta analysis found no differences in aortic morphology. significant differences were found when iliac morphology was compared, with patients in the lp group having more challenging iliac anatomies compared with the sp patients. the diameter of the external iliac arteries was significantly different (table iii). significant differences were quantified when comparing the proportion of patients with minimal external iliac diameters of both external iliac arteries <7 mm (6.9% in group sp vs 22.2% in group lp; p=.0023). significant differences were demonstrated between the groups in the proportion of patients with an iliac tortuosity index ratio >1.5 (7 in group sp vs 22 in group lp; p = .002), or bilateral significant iliac angulation of external iliac arteries (16 in group sp vs 33 in group lp; p = .003). the median iliac tortuosity index ratio in both cohorts was similar (p = .173 for both; p = .332 for the left side and p = .341 for the right side); in the sp group, this was 1.3 (iqr, 1.2-1.4; mean, 1.35 plus/minus 0.19) for the left and 1.3 (iqr, 1.2-1.4; mean, 1.34 plus/minus 0.19) for the right side (p = .611), and in the lp group was 1.4 (iqr, 1.2-1.5; mean, 1.38 plus/minus 0.19) for the left and 1.3 (iqr, 1.2-1.5; mean, 1.36 plus/minus 0.19) for the right side (p = .613). technical success rate was similar in both groups (97% in group sp vs 99% in group lp; p = .622). respectively, 30% and 31% of patients in the sp and lp groups (p= .612) underwent full percutaneous procedure. no differences in access-related postoperative complications were found (4 patients in the sp group and 0 in the lp group; p = .122). the number of supplementary procedures performed during the initial intervention was higher in the sp group than in the lp group, but the difference was not statistically significant (p ¼ .205; table iv). none were planned preoperatively and were all due to intraoperative findings. the median follow-up was 45 (iqr, 39-55) months for the sp group and 24 (iqr, 19-29) months for the lp group (p < .0001). the postoperative course was similar in both groups. no 30-day deaths were recorded in either group. freedom from reintervention (fig 1) and overall patient survival (fig 2) were similar at 1 and 2 years (log-rank test p= .183 and p= .86, respectively). the 2-year rate for freedom from limb occlusion was similar in both groups, 92% in sp and 95% in lp (p=.293). no stent fractures and no stent graft migrations were reported during the study period. late reinterventions are reported table v. both groups had a similar number of endoleaks during the follow-up (table vi). no aaa ruptures happened during the study period. one patient in each group required an aortic stent graft explantation during follow-up; the patient in the sp group underwent explantation 2.5 years after the index procedure for a persistent proximal type i endoleak, and the stent graft was removed in a lp group patient due to stent graft thrombosis. in a multivariate logistic regression model, the main predictor of postoperative events (composite criteria) was a left external iliac artery diameter <7 mm with an odds ratio of 1.753 (95% confidence interval [ci], 1.314- 2.338; p= .0001). patients with a bilateral iliac diameter <7 mm had a point estimate of 4.854 (95% ci, 1.484-15.973; p = .009; table vii). the focus of this report is the patient who was treated with a cook standard profile device (tffb) that experienced a type 1a endoleak and required a late postoperative reintervention (more than 30 days). additional reports originating from this journal article will be submitted under the manufacturer

occurred; nor is it admission that any cook device caused, contributed to, or is likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if a malfunction occurred..investigation / evaluation: on 02oct2023, cook was informed of a published article written by sobocinski et al. the article is entitled, ¿evaluation of the zenith low profile abdominal aortic aneurysm stent graft,¿ and was published in august 2015. the current study enrolled all patients treated for elective evar by the sp zenith flex stent graft (cook medical, bloomington, ind) between march 2010 and november 2011 and patients treated for elective evar by the zenith lp stent graft (cook medical) between november 2011 and march 2013. all patients had a follow-up >18 months. preoperative computed tomography angiograms were analyzed on a dedicated three-dimensional workstation. all data were prospectively collected in an electronic database and retrospectively analyzed. a comparative study was conducted. summarized in table v on page 845 in the article. the focus of this investigation was the patient that was treated with a standard profile device that experienced a type 1a endoleak and required a late postoperative reintervention (more than 30 days). it was determined with the dates given that the device was likely a tffb-zt device. reviews of the documentation, including the complaint history, drawing, instructions for use (ifu), manufacturing instructions, quality control procedures and specifications of the device, were conducted during the investigation. the complaint device was not returned for evaluation; therefore, a physical examination could not be conducted. medical imaging was not provided for review. however, a document-based investigation evaluation was performed. a review of the device master record (dmr) concluded that appropriate inspections are in place relative to the reported device failure. a review of the device history record (dhr) could not be completed, due to the lack of lot information from the facility. cook was also able to review product labeling. the ifu t_zaaaf_rev5 was reviewed for this complaint. the ifu includes the following, warnings, precautions, and instructions for proper placement of the device. 4 warnings and precautions: 4.1 general: additional endovascular interventions or conversion to standard open surgical repair following initial endovascular repair should be considered for patients experiencing an enlarging aneurysm, unacceptable decrease in fixation length (vessel and component overlap) and/or endoleak. an increase in aneurysm size and/or persistent endoleak or migration may lead to aneurysm rupture. patients experiencing reduced blood flow through the graft limb and/or leaks may be required to undergo secondary interventions or surgical procedures. 4.2 patient selection, treatment and follow-up: key anatomical elements that may affect successful exclusion of the aneurysm include sever proximal neck angulation (>60 degrees for infrarenal neck to axis of aaa or >45 degrees for suprarenal neck relative to the immediate infrarenal neck); short proximal aortic neck (<15 mm); an inverted funnel shape (greater than 10% increase in diameter over 15 mm of proximal aortic neck length); and circumferential thrombus and/or calcification at the arterial implantation sites, specifically the proximal aortic neck and distal iliac artery interface. in the presence of anatomical limitations, a longer neck may be required to obtain adequate sealing and fixation. irregular calcification and/or plaque may compromise the attachment and sealing at the fixation sites. necks exhibiting these key anatomical elements may be more conducive to graft migration or endoleak. adequate iliac or femoral access is required to introduce the device into the vasculature. access vessel diameter (measured inner wall to inner wall) and morphology (minimal tortuosity, occlusive disease and/or calcification) should be compatible with vascular access techniques and delivery systems of a 16 french to 22 french vascular introducer sheaths. vessels that are significantly calcified, occlusive, tortuous, or thrombus-lined may preclude placement of the endovascular graft and/or may increase the risk of embolization. a vascular conduit technique may be necessary to achieve success in some patients. 4.3 pre-procedure measurement techniques and imaging lengths. the long-term performance of endovascular grafts has not yet been established. all patients should be advised that endovascular treatment requires life-long, regular follow-up to access their health and the performance of their endovascular graft. patients with specific clinical findings (e.g., endoleaks, enlarging aneurysm or changes in the structure or position of the endovascular graft) should receive enhanced follow-up. specific follow-up guidelines are described in section 12, imaging guidelines and postoperative follow-up. after endovascular graft placement, patients should be regularly monitored for perigraft lfow, aneurysm growth or changes in the structure or position of the endovascular graft. at a minimum, annual imaging is required, including: 1) abdominal radiographs to examine device integrity (separation between components, stent fracture or barb separation) and 2) contrast and non-contrast ct to examine aneurysm changes, perigraft flow, patency, tortuosity, and progressive disease. if renal complications or other factors preclude the use of image contrast media, abdominal radiographs and duplex ultrasound may provide similar information. 4.4 device selection: strict adherence to the zenith flex aaa endovascular graft ifu sizing guide is strongly recommended when selecting the appropriate device size (tables 10.5.1 through 10.5.2). appropriate device oversizing has been incorporated into the ifu sizing guide. sizing outside of this range can result in endoleak, fracture, migration, device folding or compression. 4.5 implant procedure: do not bend or kink the delivery system. doing so may cause damage to the delivery system and the zenith flex aaa endovascular graft. do not continue advancing any portion of the delivery system if resistance is felt during advancement of the wire guide or delivery system. stop and assess the cause of resistance; vessel, catheter or graft damage may occur. exercise particular care i areas of stenosis, intravascular thrombosis or in calcified or tortuous vessels. inaccurate placement and/or incomplete sealing of the zenith flex aaa endovascular graft within the vessel may result in increased risk of endoleak, migration or inadvertent occlusion of the renal or internal iliac arteries. renal artery patency must be maintained of the renal or internal iliac arteries. renal artery patency must be maintained to prevent/reduce the risk of renal failure and subsequent complications. inaccurate fixation of the zenith flex aaa endovascular graft may result in increased risk of migration of the stent graft. incorrect deployment or migration of the endoprosthesis may require surgical intervention. 5.2 potential adverse events: aneurysm enlargement, aneurysm rupture and death, claudication (e.g., buttock, lower limb), endoleak. endoprosthesis: improper component placement; incomplete component deployment; component migration; suture break; occlusion; infection; stent fracture; graft material wear; dilatation; erosion; puncture; perigraft flow; barb separation and corrosion surgical conversion to open repair. 7.1 individualization of treatment: additional considerations for patient selection include but are not limited to: patient¿s age and life expectancy. co-morbidities (e.g., cardiac, pulmonary, or renal insufficiency prior to surgery, morbid obesity). patient¿s suitability for open surgical repair. patient¿s anatomical suitability for endovascular repair. ability to tolerate general, regional, or local anesthesia. iliofemoral access vessel size and morphology (minimal thrombus, calcium and/or tortuosity) should be compatible with vascular access techniques and accessories of the delivery system profile of a 16 french to 22 french vascular introducer sheath. iliac artery distal fixation site greater than 10 mm in length and 7.5 to 20 mm in diameter (measured outer wall to outer wall). freedom from significant femoral/iliac artery occlusive disease that would impede flow through the endovascular graft. 8 patient counseling information: the long-term performance of endovascular grafts has not yet been established. all patients should be advised that endovascular treatment requires lifelong, regular follow-up to assess their health and the performance of their endovascular graft. patients with specific clinical findings (e.g., endoleaks, enlarging aneurysms or changes in the structure or position of the endovascular graft) should receive enhanced follow-up. specific follow-up guidelines are described in section 12, imaging guidelines and postoperative follow-up. patients should be counseled on the importance of adhering to the follow-up schedule, both during the first year and at yearly intervals thereafter. patients should be told that regular and consistent follow-up is a critical part of ensuring the ongoing safety and effectiveness of endovascular treatment of aaas. at a minimum, annual imaging and adherence to routine postoperative follow-up requirements are required and should be considered a lifelong commitment to the patient¿s health and well-being. physicians must advise each patient that it is important to seek prompt medical attention if they experience signs of limb occlusion, aneurysm enlargement or rupture. signs of graft limb occlusion include pain in the hip(s) or leg(s) during walking or at rest or discoloration or coolness of the leg. aneurysm rupture may be asymptomatic, but usually presents as: pain; numbness; weakness in the legs; any back, chest, abdominal or groin pain; dizziness; fainting; rapid heartbeat or sudden weakness. physicians should refer patients to the patient guide regarding risks occurring during or after implantation of the device. procedure-related risks include cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, bowel and bleeding complications. device-related risks include occlusion, endoleak, aneurysm enlargement, fracture, potential for reintervention and open surgical conversion, rupture and death (see section 5.1, observed adverse events and section 5.2 potential adverse events). the physician should complete the patient i.d. card and give it to the patient so that he/she can carry it with him/her at all times. the patient should refer to the card anytime he/she visits additional health practitioners, particularly for any additional <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> procedures (e.g., mri). 12 imaging guidelines and postoperative follow-up: 12.1 general: the long-term performance of endovascular grafts has not yet been established. all patients should be advised that endovascular treatment requires lifelong, regular follow-up to assess their health and performance of their endovascular graft. patients with specific clinical findings (e.g., endoleaks, enlarging aneurysms or changes in the structure or position of the endovascular graft) should receive additional follow-up. patients should be counseled on the importance of adhering to the follow-up. patients should be counseled on the importance of adhering to the follow-up. patients should be counseled on the importance of adhering to the follow-up schedule, both during the first year and at yearly intervals thereafter. patients should be told that regular and consistent follow-up is a critical part of ensuring the ongoing safety and effectiveness of endovascular treatment aaas. physicians should evaluate patients on an individual basis and prescribe their follow-up relative to the needs and circumstances of each individual patient. the recommended imaging schedule is presented in table 12.1.1. this schedule was used in the pivotal trial and is recommended even in the absence of clinical symptoms (e.g., endoleaks, enlarging aneurysms or changes in the structure or position of the stent graft) should receive follow-up at more frequent intervals. the combination of contrast and non-contrast ct imaging provides information on aneurysm diameter change, endoleak, patency, tortuosity, progressive disease, fixation length and other morphological changes. duplex ultrasound imaging may provide information on aneurysm diameter change, endoleak, patency, tortuosity, and progressive disease. in this circumstance, a non-contrast ct should be performed to use in conjunction with the ultrasound. ultrasound may be a less reliable and sensitive <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> method compared to ct. after review of the ifu, cook has concluded the device labeling contains appropriate warnings, precautions and instructions to the user related to the reported failure. evidence provided by the customer, complaint history, manufacturing documents, and verification testing, suggests that the device was manufactured to specification. there is no evidence of nonconforming devices in house or in the field. based on the information provided, no returned product, and the results of our investigation, a definitive cause for the failure could not be established. endoleaks are a known inherent risk of using the device per the ifu. the appropriate personnel have been notified. per the risk assessment no further action is required. we will continue to monitor for similar complaints. this report is required by the fda under 21 cfr part 803 and is based on unconfirmed information submitted by others. neither the submission of this report nor any statement contained herein is intended to be an admission that any cook device is defective or malfunctioned, that a death or serious injury occurred, nor that any cook device caused, contributed to, or is likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if a

(2015). evaluation of the zenith low-profile abdominal aortic aneurysm stent graft. journal of vascular surgery, 62(4), 841¿847. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2015.04.452. the current study enrolled all patients treated for elective evar by the sp zenith flex stent graft (cook medical, bloomington, ind) between march 2010 and november 2011 and patients treated for elective evar by the zenith lp stent graft (cook medical) between november 2011 and march 2013. all patients had a follow-up >18 months. preoperative computed tomography angiograms were analyzed on a dedicated three-dimensional workstation. all data were prospectively collected in an electronic database and retrospectively analyzed. a comparative study was conducted. methods: all patients treated for elective infrarenal aortic or common iliac aneurysms using evar at our institution between march 2010 and april 2013 were included in this retrospective study. all custom-made devices, including fenestrated or branched aortic stent grafts, were excluded. the medical records and images from a prospectively collected database were analyzed retrospectively. all patients gave their informed consent to be included in the present study, which was approved by our local ethics committee. two groups of patients were identified: the sp group included all patients treated between march 2010 and november 2011 with a combination of sp (18f to 22f) aaa stent grafts comprising a zenith flex (cook medical, bloomington, in) bifurcated main body graft (tffb) and iliac legs (tfle). the lp group included all patients treated between november 2011 and april 2013 with a combination of lp (16f) aaa stent graft comprising a zenith lp (cook medical) main bifurcated body (zalb) and spiral-z iliac legs (zsle). these devices are currently available in europe but not in the united states. all computed tomography angiograms were analyzed on a dedicated imaging workstation by two endovascular therapists (j.s., f.b.) trained in planning and sizing of standard and complex evar cases. we evaluated the computed tomography angiographies (ctas) according to ghatwary et al. a centerline of flow reconstruction using a semiautomated centerline <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> was generated to assess aortic and iliac morphologies. the following anatomical criteria were collected as described by the society for vascular surgery reporting standards aortic/iliac diameters and lengths at the level of the proximal and the distal sealing zones, maximum aortic diameter of the aneurysm and diameter of the aortoiliac bifurcation, tortuosity index of the iliac axis by applying a ratio of the distance depicted using the centerline of flow between the aortoiliac bifurcation and the iliofemoral junction to the distance of a straight-line between those two points (modified method recently described by kristmundsson et al). and presence of long (>1 cm) circumferential calcification with significant stenosis >50% of the iliac artery. calcification and stenosis as defined previously were defined as ¿hostile¿ arteries. the quality of the proximal and distal sealing zones related to the presence of arterial wall thrombus or calcifications, or both, were also assessed. for each group of patients, the preoperative aortoiliac anatomy was assessed in accordance with the ifu criteria for evar, based on european guidelines. patients¿ characteristics and surgical data were collected (tables i and ii). postoperative events, including complications and subsequent reinterventions, during follow-up were collected. the freedom from late reintervention and patient overall survival curves at 1 and 2 years were calculated for each group according to the kaplan-meier method; a log-rank test was applied to compare both cohorts. at the time of this study, cta was routinely performed before hospital discharge. patients with poor renal function (postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate clearance of <45 ml/min/1.73 m2) had a contrast-free ct and a contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination. post discharge follow-up included an ultrasound examination at 6 months and cta at 12 months. both examinations were repeated annually. a maximal aortic diameter enlargement or shrinkage >5 mm was considered significant. statistics: statistical analysis was performed using software and graphs were drawn with software. categoric and continuous variables were collected for all patients in the study. continuous variables are expressed as median and interquartile ranges (iqrs) or mean and standard error of the mean, and categoric variables as percentage. the fisher exact x 2 tests were used to study significant differences between the group sp and group lp patients for categoric variables. a p value of<.05 was considered to determine significant differences. kaplan-meier survival curves are presented and compared using log-rank tests for testing significant differences between survival curves. a predictive model was developed to demonstrate any correlation between preoperative characteristics with a composite outcome of death less than or equal to 24 months, reintervention or endoleak, and other defined complications. a binary variable representing this composite outcome measure was modeled. inclusion of variables in the model with p less than or equal to 0.2 were based on the fisher exact test for categoric variables and univariate logistic regressions for continuous variables. a multivariate logistic regression model with backward selection was fitted. results: the study included 208 patients, with 107 patients in the sp group and 101 in the lp group. preoperative characteristics were comparable (table i). preoperative cta analysis found no differences in aortic morphology. significant differences were found when iliac morphology was compared, with patients in the lp group having more challenging iliac anatomies compared with the sp patients. the diameter of the external iliac arteries was significantly different (table iii). significant differences were quantified when comparing the proportion of patients with minimal external iliac diameters of both external iliac arteries <7 mm (6.9% in group sp vs 22.2% in group lp; p=.0023). significant differences were demonstrated between the groups in the proportion of patients with an iliac tortuosity index ratio >1.5 (7 in group sp vs 22 in group lp; p = .002), or bilateral significant iliac angulation of external iliac arteries (16 in group sp vs 33 in group lp; p = .003). the median iliac tortuosity index ratio in both cohorts was similar (p = .173 for both; p = .332 for the left side and p = .341 for the right side); in the sp group, this was 1.3 (iqr, 1.2-1.4; mean, 1.35 plus/minus 0.19) for the left and 1.3 (iqr, 1.2-1.4; mean, 1.34 plus/minus 0.19) for the right side (p = .611), and in the lp group was 1.4 (iqr, 1.2-1.5; mean, 1.38 plus/minus 0.19) for the left and 1.3 (iqr, 1.2-1.5; mean, 1.36 plus/minus 0.19) for the right side (p = .613). technical success rate was similar in both groups (97% in group sp vs 99% in group lp; p = .622). respectively, 30% and 31% of patients in the sp and lp groups (p= .612) underwent full percutaneous procedure. no differences in access-related postoperative complications were found (4 patients in the sp group and 0 in the lp group; p = .122). the number of supplementary procedures performed during the initial intervention was higher in the sp group than in the lp group, but the difference was not statistically significant (p ¼ .205; table iv). none were planned preoperatively and were all due to intraoperative findings. the median follow-up was 45 (iqr, 39-55) months for the sp group and 24 (iqr, 19-29) months for the lp group (p < .0001). the postoperative course was similar in both groups. no 30-day deaths were recorded in either group. freedom from reintervention (fig 1) and overall patient survival (fig 2) were similar at 1 and 2 years (log-rank test p= .183 and p= .86, respectively). the 2-year rate for freedom from limb occlusion was similar in both groups, 92% in sp and 95% in lp (p=.293). no stent fractures and no stent graft migrations were reported during the study period. late reinterventions are reported table v. both groups had a similar number of endoleaks during the follow-up (table vi). no aaa ruptures happened during the study period. one patient in each group required an aortic stent graft explantation during follow-up; the patient in the sp group underwent explantation 2.5 years after the index procedure for a persistent proximal type i endoleak, and the stent graft was removed in a lp group patient due to stent graft thrombosis. in a multivariate logistic regression model, the main predictor of postoperative events (composite criteria) was a left external iliac artery diameter <7 mm with an odds ratio of 1.753 (95% confidence interval [ci], 1.314- 2.338; p= .0001). patients with a bilateral iliac diameter <7 mm had a point estimate of 4.854 (95% ci, 1.484-15.973; p = .009; table vii). the focus of this report is the patient who was treated with a standard profile device that experienced a persistent high flow proximal type 1 eandoleak, discovered during follow up at 2.5 years after index procedure and required explantation.

receive enhanced follow-up. specific follow-up guidelines are described in section 12, imaging guidelines and postoperative follow-up.¿	after endovascular graft placement, patients should be regularly monitored for perigraft lfow, aneurysm growth or changes in the structure or position of the endovascular graft. at a minimum, annual imaging is required, including: 1) abdominal radiographs to examine device integrity (separation between         components, stent fracture or barb separation) and 2) contrast and non-contrast ct to examine aneurysm changes, perigraft flow, patency, tortuosity, and progressive disease. if renal complications or other factors preclude the use of image contrast media, abdominal radiographs and duplex ultrasound may         provide similar information.4.4 device selection¿	strict adherence to the zenith flex aaa endovascular graft ifu sizing guide is strongly recommended when selecting the appropriate device size (tables 10.5.1 through 10.5.2). appropriate device oversizing has been incorporated into the ifu sizing guide. sizing outside of this range can result in endoleak, fracture,         migration, device folding or compression.4.5 implant procedure¿	do not bend or kink the delivery system. doing so may cause damage to the delivery system and the zenith flex aaa endovascular graft.¿	do not continue advancing any portion of the delivery system if resistance is felt during advancement of the wire guide or delivery system. stop and assess the cause of resistance; vessel, catheter or graft damage may occur. exercise particular care i areas of stenosis, intravascular thrombosis or in calcified or         tortuous vessels.¿	inaccurate placement and/or incomplete sealing of the zenith flex aaa endovascular graft within the vessel may result in increased risk of endoleak, migration or inadvertent occlusion of the renal or internal iliac arteries. renal artery patency must be maintained of the renal or internal iliac arteries. renal artery         patency must be maintained to prevent/reduce the risk of renal failure and subsequent complications.¿	inaccurate fixation of the zenith flex aaa endovascular graft may result in increased risk of migration of the stent graft. incorrect deployment or migration of the endoprosthesis may require surgical intervention.5.2 potential adverse events¿	aneurysm enlargement¿	aneurysm rupture and death¿	claudication (e.g., buttock, lower limb)¿	endoleak¿	endoprosthesis: improper component placement; incomplete component deployment; component migration; suture break; occlusion; infection; stent fracture; graft material wear; dilatation; erosion; puncture; perigraft flow; barb separation and corrosion¿	surgical conversion to open repair7.1 individualization of treatmentadditional considerations for patient selection include but are not limited to:¿	patient¿s age and life expectancy¿	co-morbidities (e.g., cardiac, pulmonary, or renal insufficiency prior to surgery, morbid obesity)¿	patient¿s suitability for open surgical repair¿	patient¿s anatomical suitability for endovascular repair¿	ability to tolerate general, regional, or local anesthesia.¿	iliofemoral access vessel size and morphology (minimal thrombus, calcium and/or tortuosity) should be compatible with vascular access techniques and accessories of the delivery system profile of a 16 french to 22 french vascular introducer sheath.¿	iliac artery distal fixation site greater than 10 mm in length and 7.5 to 20 mm in diameter (measured outer wall to outer wall)¿	freedom from significant femoral/iliac artery occlusive disease that would impede flow through the endovascular graft.8 patient counseling information¿	the long-term performance of endovascular grafts has not yet been established. all patients should be advised that endovascular treatment requires lifelong, regular follow-up to assess their health and the performance of their endovascular graft. patients with specific clinical findings (e.g., endoleaks, enlarging         aneurysms or changes in the structure or position of the endovascular graft) should receive enhanced follow-up. specific follow-up guidelines are described in section 12, imaging guidelines and postoperative follow-up.¿	physicians must advise each patient that it is important to seek prompt medical attention if they experience signs of limb occlusion, aneurysm enlargement or rupture. signs of graft limb occlusion include pain in the hip(s) or leg(s) during walking or at rest or discoloration or coolness of the leg. aneurysm rupture         may be asymptomatic, but usually presents as: pain; numbness; weakness in the legs; any back, chest, abdominal or groin pain; dizziness; fainting; rapid heartbeat or sudden weakness.physicians should refer patients to the patient guide regarding risks occurring during or after implantation of the device. procedure-related risks include cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, bowel and bleeding complications. device-related risks include occlusion, endoleak, aneurysm enlargement, fracture, potential for reintervention and open surgical conversion, rupture and death (see section 5.1, observed adverse events and section 5.2 potential adverse events). the physician should complete the patient i.d. card and give it to the patient so that he/she can carry it with him/her at all times. the patient should refer to the card anytime he/she visits additional health practitioners, particularly for any additional <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> procedures (e.g., mri).12 imaging guidelines and postoperative follow-up 12.1 general¿	the long-term performance of endovascular grafts has not yet been established. all patients should be advised that endovascular treatment requires lifelong, regular follow-up to assess their health and performance of their endovascular graft. patients with specific clinical findings (e.g., endoleaks, enlarging         aneurysms or changes in the structure or position of the endovascular graft) should receive additional follow-up. patients should be counseled on the importance of adhering to the follow-up. patients should be counseled on the importance of adhering to the follow-up. patients should be counseled on the         importance of adhering to the follow-up schedule, both during the first year and at yearly intervals thereafter. patients should be told that regular and consistent follow-up is a critical part of ensuring the ongoing safety and effectiveness of endovascular treatment aaas.¿	physicians should evaluate patients on an individual basis and prescribe their follow-up relative to the needs and circumstances of each individual patient. the recommended imaging schedule is presented in table 12.1.1. this schedule was used in the pivotal trial and is recommended even in the absence of         clinical symptoms (e.g., endoleaks, enlarging aneurysms or changes in the structure or position of the stent graft) should receive follow-up at more frequent intervals.¿	the combination of contrast and non-contrast ct imaging provides information on aneurysm diameter change, endoleak, patency, tortuosity, progressive disease, fixation length and other morphological changes.¿	duplex ultrasound imaging may provide information on aneurysm diameter change, endoleak, patency, tortuosity, and progressive disease. in this circumstance, a non-contrast ct should be performed to use in conjunction with the ultrasound. ultrasound may be a less reliable and sensitive <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> method compared to ct.after review of the ifu, cook has concluded the device labeling contains appropriate warnings, precautions and instructions to the user related

baby was treated with anti-retroviral medication due to (b)(6) results measured from the patient's mother when tested with the elecsys (b)(6) duo assay on a cobas 8000 e 801 module (serial number (b)(4)). the issue was reportedly found as a part of a high risk obstetric delivery. it was reported that a first sample collected from the baby's mother resulted in (b)(6)duo values of (b)(6). values from this sample were reported outside of the laboratory. it was reported that the mother was not known to be (b)(6) for (b)(6). the mother's baby was reportedly treated with (b)(6) treatment based on results of the mother's first sample. the baby was reported to have received this treatment until (b)(6)pcr tests for both the mother and baby were (b)(6). the mother was reported to have not received any anti retroviral treatment. a second sample collected from the mother reportedly measured the same (b)(6) result with the (b)(6) duo assay. this sample was sent to another laboratory for testing where it was reported that the (b)(6) rna viral load result was allegedly"not detected". the baby was reported to be eventually diagnosed with congenital syphilis and was treated with a 10 day course of penicillin g. the baby is still in the newborn intensive care unit because of their prematurity.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:investigations of the patient sample could reproduce the customer's issue. the sample showed reactivity with one hiv-1 specific peptide only. this suggests the sample had a false reactive hiv duo result as real hiv-positive samples normally react against more than one hiv specific antigen. the hiv duo assay performs within specifications according to the clinical specificity claim in product labeling..upon review of the alarm trace from (b)(6) 2022, no relevant alarms were observed around the time of sample measurement. later that day, 4 sample pipetting alarms are observed. per product labeling: "repeatedly reactive samples must be confirmed according to cdc recommended confirmatory <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>s. the subresults for either (b)(6) or (b)(6) can be used as an aid in the selection of the confirmation <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> for reactive samples." calibration signals were within expected ranges for the (b)(6) duo assay. the customer uses third party controls and based on the data provided, these were within specified ranges. a sample from the mother was provided for investigation. the investigation is ongoing.</p><hr><h3 id="ALG-DIAG-037">Result ALG-DIAG-037</h3><p><a

reported to biomérieux false resistant carbapenamase results for a patient with prolonged bacteremia with salmonella typhi, in association with the vitek® 2 ast-gn213 test kit (udi (b)(4)). the customer reported that testing of two separate blood cultures from the patient gave inconsistent results. the organism was identified as salmonella species by vitek® 2 and maldi-tof. the first blood culture results with vitek® 2 ast-gn213 showed ertapenem and meropenem sensitive and this was reported as preliminary results. the ciprofloxacin was reported as resistant based on vitek® 2 and etest® results. the second blood culture test results twice showed carbapenem resistance to both ertapenem and meropenem. the customer also performed etest® and mast disc set which were carbapenem negative. the isolate was also sent to a reference lab in which it was negative for carbapenamase resistance. the customer stated tests were repeated and a corrected report was issued due to an instrument testing error. the customer reported the patient was unnecessarily placed on infection control precautions for a possible carbapenem producing organism, and due to erroneous results, there was a 5 day delay for treatment of the appropriate antibiotics (ceftriaxone) to the patient.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:a biomérieux investigation was performed. the investigation was initiated in response to customer complaints reporting holes in the white card pouches of some cards at the stitch seam. the root cause of the defect was linked to the design of the wheel that applies the stitch seal to the pouch. on (b)(6), the stitch wheels with a new design were installed that resolved the issue. there are no documented studies to indicate which substrates are moisture sensitive in the vitek® 2 id cards and what type of atypical reactions these may cause. however, the id <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> generally allows two (2) atypical reactions and will still give an identification with a high degree of confidence. the knowledge bases are designed to account for both typical and atypical strains so an aberrant reaction should have low impact on identification results. for gn & gp, a kinetic <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> is used, which means that identifications are attempted every 15 minutes starting at 2 hours. a kinetic <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> does not necessarily use all the tests on the card to make an identification, which also reduces the impact of an atypical result for these two cards. urea has shown some sensitivity to moisture by giving a false positive reaction. therefore, data analysis was performed where the urea well (ure) results stored in the knowledge base for all test isolates were forced to be initial value positive to evaluate a worst case scenario. five (5) out of the seven (7) id cards (anc, gn, gp, nh and yst) were evaluated. cbc was not manufactured in the white webbing during 12sep2016 and on (b)(6) 2017 and bcl does not contain ure. the results show that all but one (1) card gave 95% identification agreement between the knowledge bases in vitek® 2 7.01 software and the knowledge bases, which were altered to give all ure positive results. the id card that did not meet the 95% agreement rate was anc at 92.8% with ci (92.2%, 93.5%). based on this analysis, gn, gp, yst and nh show no significant impact on performance when ure is forced positive. anc did not meet the criteria but is within 2.2% of meeting it. the antimicrobials most affected by moisture include the beta-lactams, primarily carbapenems and penicillins, and some cephalosporins, but not all cephalosporins are affected the same. beta-lactams are more sensitive in general to moisture, due to their structure. the main degradation is hydrolysis, which means a molecule of beta-lactam reacts with a molecule of water. other main antimicrobial classes, such as fluoroquinolones, or aminoglycosides, are not considered moisture sensitive. macrolides generally are not moisture sensitive, but erythromycin is. also affected by moisture is nitrofurantoin (furanes class), and clavulanic acid (a beta-lactamase inhibitor, used in combination with a penicillin, or in combination with cephalosporins, as in the case of the esbl test). the moisture will tend to degrade the antimicrobial, so the effect is less antimicrobial available in the vitek® 2 well, and therefore, the expected effect on results would be elevated mics, or false resistance. one exception would be the esbl test, which could be falsely negative, if the clavulanic acid was degraded due to moisture. for ast-gn cards, at least one carbapenem would be included in the card configuration, and the card would likely include a penicillin, and multiple cephalosporins. for ast-gp cards, the card configuration would usually include at least one penicillin, usually oxacillin, and usually nitrofurantoin. the expected result of tears/holes in the pouch due to the previous stitch seal would be moisture degradation of the antimicrobials, thereby elevating the mics, or causing false resistance. if mics were elevated enough to change the interpretation of the result from s to i, or i to r, or s to r, then the risk is that an antimicrobial that may have been a first line therapy may not be used. if this occurred for multiple antimicrobials, several that may have been candidates for therapy may be excluded. the exception to the false resistance or elevated mics would be the esbl test, which could be falsely negative. this test is primarily used for epidemiology purposes, or infection control, and not necessarily for treatment. field safety corrective action (fsca) (b)(4) was issued on 19apr2017 to impacted biomérieux subsidiaries and distributors to notify customers of this issue. this discrepancy was reviewed for vigilance reporting according to 21 cfr 803 concerning medical device reporting. in this case, there is no information to support negative patient impact or serious adverse events occurred as a result of this discrepancy; however, the customer reported a delay of greater than 24 hours. therefore, this discrepancy is reportable as a malfunction based upon biomérieux standard operating procedure (sop) 031879, section 4.3.3.2 that indicates injury or illness could result from a delay in the appropriate <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> or therapy, or result from continued administration of inappropriate antimicrobials or other potentially toxic therapies due to a delay in determining the infecting agent's identification and susceptibility profile.</p><hr><h3 id="ALG-DIAG-038">Result ALG-DIAG-038</h3><p><a

nervous system 34 (2018). doi: 10.1007/s00381-017-3648-y abstract purpose cerebrospinal fluid diversion via ventricular shunt is a common treatment for hydrocephalus. change in cranial morphology associated with a sutural fusion has been termed shunt-related or induced craniosynostosis (src) or craniocerebral disproportion (ccd). we present a series of patients with src who underwent cranial vault remodeling (cvr) and our treatment <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>. methods thirteen patients were retrospectively reviewed who had src and cvr; 92%of patients had a ventriculoperitoneal (vp) shunt placed for largely intraventricular hemorrhage of prematurity (69% of patients) at a mean age of 2.2 months. the shunt revision rate was 38.4%, and 54% of patients had a programmable shunt placed initially. results the mean age at time of cvr was 3.6 years old. the most commonly affected sutures (ct confirmed) were the sagittal and coronal sutures, with three patients exhibiting pancraniosynostosis. the mean time from placement of the shunt to ct evidence of sutural fusion was 2.0 years. abnormal head shape was noted in all 13 patients; 11 of these also had either chronic headaches, papilledema, seizures, or behavioral changes in the setting of functional shunt. mean follow-up after the initial cvr was 3.3 years. no shunt infections were attributed to the cvr. the families of all patients were contacted and reported improvement in head shape with 60% of families reporting improvement in behavior, 75% reported improvement in headaches, and 40% reported decrease in seizure frequency or intensity. shunt setting or type was not routinely changed after cvr. conclusions our threshold for cvr in src is met when shunt malfunction has been ruled out and there are

maintenance fluconazole since her initial <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b>. ct of the head demonstrated enlarged lateral and third ventricles without dilation of the fourth ventricle. mri of the brain showed enhancement of her basilar meninges and communicating hydrocephalus. she was stabilized with an evd and then underwent a frontal vps with a medtronic programmable valve set at 1.5. she underwent additional treatment with amphotericin and then resumed maintenance fluconazole. ct of the head at 1 year showed no signs of hydrocephalus. after an initial period of improvement, her symptoms reappeared and ct of the head showed relapse of her 4th vm and subependymal fluid around the fourth ventricle but not the lateral or third ventricles. the fourth ventricular catheter was externalized. it was determined that subzero drainage (at negative 10 cm relative to her eac) was required to decompress her fourth ventricle. she did not respond to internalization of her fourth ventricle catheter to her pleural space. she ultimately required insertion of bilateral fourth ventricular catheters with routing to her pleural space without any intervening valves.</p><p><b>Event

2007 and had to explant the lens the next day due to an increase in the patient's intraocular pressure to 35 mmhg. the surgeon first gave the patient iop lowering medications, but the chamber was very shallow and the pressure remained high, the patient's pupil was dilated and the icl was beginning to vault excessively. the surgeon was afraid to burp the wound for fear of any iris prolapse. the surgeon then created a third pi, but the condition remained the same. patient was sent to a vitreo-retinal specialist in the morning where a <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> of aqueous misdirection was made so an anterior vitrectomy was performed. after the vitrectomy, the icl vault was normal and the chamber became deep. the patient's iop also went down, but the pupils remained dilated. the excessive vaulting, increased iop and shallow chamber were all secondary to the aqueous misdirection therefore, after the vitrectomy, everything went back to normal, however, a cataract formation was noted after the vitrectomy and the surgeon needed to remove the lens and perform a lensectomy with iol implantation. patient's vision at this point is 20/50, with pupil still dilated.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:evaluation -a lens serial work order search was performed for similar complaints within the search and there were no similar complaints. conclusions - at the conclusion of the original investigation opened for the issue of icl vaulting (both inadequate and excessive), it was determined that the most likely root cause for both inadequate and excessive vault is difficulty in clinical sizing. in no case has a returned lens exhibited a length measurement outside the expected range according to the labeled length. pre-operative measurement technology available to clinicians in the past did not provide a direct measurement of the sulcus, to which the icl should be sized. the current practice in selecting an appropriate icl for a patient is to measure white-to-white and anterior chamber depth and through correlative <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> predict the length of the icl that will bridge the sulcus. this method of sizing based upon white-to-white and anterior chamber depth measurements was used in the fda clinical trial and is recommended in the current labeling of the icl. if the predicted length is too short, the result may be

index (ai) to guide ventricular tachycardia (vt) ablation in patients with structural heart disease is unknown. the aim of this study was to assess procedural characteristics and clinical outcomes achieved using ai-guided strategy (target value 550) or conventional non-ai-guided parameters in patients undergoing scar-related vt ablation. methods: consecutive patients (n = 103) undergoing initial vt ablation at a single center from 2017 to 2022 were evaluated. patient groups were 1:1 propensity-matched for baseline characteristics. single lesion characteristics for all 4707 lesions in the matched cohort (n = 74) were analyzed. the impact of ablation characteristics was assessed by linear regression and clinical outcomes were evaluated by cox proportional hazard model. results: after propensity-matching, baseline characteristics were well-balanced between<b style='color:red;'> ai </b>(n = 37) and non-ai (n = 37) groups. lesion sets were similar (scar homogenization [41% vs. 27%; p = .34], scar dechanneling [19% vs. 8%; p = .18], core isolation [5% vs. 11%; p = .4], linear and elimination late potentials/local abnormal ventricular activities [35% vs. 44%; p = .48], epicardial mapping/ablation [11% vs. 14%; p = .73]). ai-guided strategy had 21% lower procedure duration (-47.27 min, 95% confidence interval [ci] [-81.613, -12.928]; p = .008), 49% lower radiofrequency time per lesion (-13.707 s, 95% ci [-17.86, -9.555]; p < .001), 21% lower volume of fluid administered (1664 cc [1127, 2209] vs. 2126 cc [1750, 2593]; p = .005). total radiofrequency duration (-339 s [-24%], 95%ci [-776, 62]; p = .09) and steam pops (-155.6%, 95% ci [19.8%, -330.9%]; p = .08) were nonsignificantly lower in the<b style='color:red;'> ai </b>group. acute procedural success (95% vs. 89%; p = .7) and vt recurrence (0.97, 95% ci [0.42-2.2]; p = .93) were similar for both groups. lesion analysis (n = 4707) demonstrated a plateau in the magnitude of impedance drops

(2020). prognostic risk factors for recurrent acute lower limb ischemia in patients treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis. journal of vascular surgery, 71(4), 1268¿1275. https://doi.org /10.1016/j.jvs.2019.07.061 medtronic review of the literature article found that the article reviewed patients were treated for acute lower limb ischemic with catheter-directed thrombolysis (cdt) between march 2002 and december 2015. 303 patients with a mean age of 71 were included in the study. 52.5% of the patients were male. patients were treated under local anesthesia using either a contralateral approach or via the ipsilateral femoral artery. a multi-hole cragg-mcnamara infusion catheter was placed within the thrombus and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was administered as an initial 4mg bolus. the treatment continued with an infusion of 0.5mg/hour for a maximum of 48 hours, with control angiograms taken every 24 hours (+/- 2 hours). lytic therapy was considered complete with lysis of the thrombus and flow restoration. in some cases duplex ultrasound (us) and plain radiography were used for the differential <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> of residual thrombus during cdt. patients remained in either the intensive care unit (icu) or 24-hour observation ward until the thrombolytic treatment was completed. heparin was not administered through the sheath, but rather subcutaneously twice daily. treatment duration with low-molecular-weight heparin ranged from several days to a maximum of several weeks depending on the patient¿s level of physical activity and the need for continuous oral anticoagulant therapy which varied. the patients were observed for varying periods. most patients underwent the first routine follow-up visit at 1 month post-procedure. subsequent follow-up visits were scheduled at different time intervals until the patients did not require additional manipulations and there were no symptoms and signs of critical limb ischemia. in further post-thrombolytic follow-up, native arterial and proximal bypass graft patients (above-knee) underwent physical examinations in their regional primary health care centers once a year or more frequently. ultrasound and ankle-brachial index (abi) measurements were performed on symptomatic patients. below-knee bypass graft patients underwent hospital follow-up biannually. the visits routinely included physical examinations, abi, toe pressure measurements, and ultrasound. additional elective, urgent, and emergency follow-up visits and admissions were arranged on the basis of the clinical situation, and the need for angiography was assessed. the article noted additional treatment necessary in a majority of cases and concluded that appropriate post-thrombolytic antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment after native arterial events is of great importance, but additional data was needed to improve treatment <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>s. cdt as a single treatment was effective in 100 cases. one patient underwent preplanned adjunctive atherectomy with thrombectomy. no device malfunctions were reported. 204 additional procedures in 203 patients were required on the completion of thrombolysis to restore adequate distal perfusion. the majority of these (183) were ptas and stent applications; additional endarterectomies were needed in 13 cases. eight bypass or jump bypass reconstructions were performed to obtain sufficient distal circulation in the limb. these numbers include 45 cases of partially completed thrombolysis and additional open or endoluminal aspiration thrombectomies for the progression of ischemia during lytic therapy. a failure to dissolve the thrombus in occluded native arteries, bypass conduits, or runoff vessels resulted in four (1.3%) early major amputations performed within 10 days from the initial cdt. a total of 18 (5.9%) patients developed bleeding complications at the access site and required termination of thrombolysis and blood transfusion. in addition, four patients (1.3%) developed intracranial bleeding, and two of them died. compartment syndrome was revealed in four (1.3%) cases. lysis had to be terminated, and adjunct open thrombectomy and fasciotomy were performed on one of these patients. the three other patients did not require thrombolysis termination because the compartment syndrome developed either right after the treatment or at the end of it. a total of 130 (42.9%) acute reocclusion events of thromboembolic origin were identified during a median study period of 40 months. a total of 38 (29.2%) major amputations were performed on patients with reocclusions. the majority of the amputations (20 [52.6%]) were performed within the first month after the

doi:10.1093/icvts/ivz288 medtronic received information in a literature article of patients treated with a cragg-mcnamara infusion catheter. the purpose of this study was to compare postoperative outcomes between catheter-directed thrombolysis (cdl) and surgical pulmonary embolectomy (spe) in the treatment of life-threatening pulmonary embolectomy (pe). a retrospective single-center observational study was conducted for patients who underwent spe or cdl at a single us academic center. preprocedural and postprocedural echocardiographic data were collected. a total of 126 patients who underwent either spe (60 patients, 47.6%) or cdl (66, 52.4%) were included in this study. the decision to pursue cdl was determined by a multidisciplinary pe response team. all patients received local tissue plasminogen activator (tpa) through standard infusion catheters; unifuse (another manufacturer),  or cragg-mcnamara or ultrasound-assisted catheters (another manufacture). most patients received bilateral treatment with 2 catheters. while tpa infusions varied, the typical dose was 0.5¿1 mg/h per catheter and the duration of infusion was typically < 24 h. some patients were treated for more than 24 h when pulmonary artery pressures did not decrease significantly or when angiography showed little thrombus resolution. unfractionated heparin was delivered during tpa infusion at 5¿10 u/kg/h not to exceed 1000 u/h or a low standard protocol with heparin level monitoring per unit protocol. at 1¿2 h after termination of thrombolysis, the high-intensity heparin protocol was resumed. in general, pulmonary arterial pressures were assessed at commencement and at the termination of the infusion, and treatment decisions were based on the degree of pressure decrease measured. sixteen (26.7%) spe patients had a concomitant procedure performed. these consisted of 7 patients who underwent patent foramen ovale closure, 4 with concomitant right atrial exploration for thrombus in transit, 3 who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, 1 patient who required aortic and mitral valve replacement and 1 patient who underwent an ivc thrombectomy. thrombolytics were infused for a median of 24 h (iqr 18.0¿25.0), with a median tpadose of 24.0 mg (iqr 18.0¿25.0). forty-eight patients (72.7%) had bilateral catheters, and 18 (27.3%) had a single catheter placed in either the right or left pulmonary arterial tree. inferior vena cava filters were placed in 39 (65.0%) and 32 (48.5) patients who underwent spe and cdl, respectively. two patients in the spe group (3.3%) and 2 patients in the cdl group (3.0%) suffered in-hospital mortality rate. spe patients had a significantly higher incidence of prolonged ventilation (15.0% vs 1.5%, p = 0.01). the incidence of major bleeding requiring transfusion was also higher in the spe cohort (mean units of blood 1.6 ± 3.5 vs 0.4 ± 1.3, p = 0.01). otherwise, there was no significant difference in outcomes including postprocedural pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, renal failure or 30-day readmission. there were no intracranial haemorrhages in either group. ninety-seven patients (78%) had baseline echocardiographic data available for review, and 52 (41%) had a midterm echocardiographic follow-up. median echocardiographic follow-up was 4 months (range 1 day¿36 months). in the cdl group, 33 (56.9%) patients had moderate or severe right ventricular (rv) dysfunction at baseline, which decreased to 2 (6.5%) patients at midterm follow-up (p < 0.001). rv systolic pressure also improved, decreasing from 52.9 mmhg (iqr 42.2¿66.3) at baseline to 27.9 (20.0¿35.5), p < 0.0001. in the spe group, more patients had moderate or severe rv dysfunction at baseline (30, 76.9%), but only 4 patients (19.0%) had moderate or worse rv dysfunction at midterm follow-up (p < 0.001). rv systolic pressure also improved in the spe group from baseline to midterm [52.0 mmhg (40.0¿60.8) to 35.6 (28.5¿51.0), p <_ 0.01]. mortality rates for patients with pe vary according to the degree of rv dysfunction. patients with documented rv dysfunction in the absence of haemodynamic instability experience an in- hospital mortality rate of 5¿15%, but when rv dysfunction is so severe as to compromise cardiac output, mortality rates rise to in excess of 50%. once these patients leave the hospital, there is an ongoing mortality risk, as noted by the 21% mortality rate for patients who suffer from sub-massive pe at 3 months after initial <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> [7]. the need for better treatment <b

complication trial (dcct) and subsequently those of the epidemiology of diabetes interventions and complications study (edic) demonstrated the importance of maintaining blood glucose levels close to normal to avoid microvascular complications in people with dm1. currently, the system of choice is the intensive care basal-bolus i intended to mimic the physiological secretion by pancreatic multidose subcutaneous insulin (mdi) or continuous subcutaneous infusion of insulin (isci). therefore, the ideal insulin for bolus use would be one with a very rapid onset of action, with a short peak and a very short half-life. compared to regular insulin, rapid-acting insulin analogs or aars (lispro, aspart, and glulisine) have a faster onset of action (10-15 minutes) and a shorter half-life. however, despite these advances in their formulation, aars continue to lack a peak of action fast enough to control postprandial hyperglycemia and suppress hepatic glucose production and also have a longer duration compared to insulin secreted endogenously. in patients with integrated systems (csii with continuous interstitial glucose monitoring), the delay in the absorption and action of the aar, added to the lag in the glucose readings in interstitial fluid by the sensor and an effective integrating <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>, constitutes one of the great challenges to achieve the closed loop (artificial pancreas). the new insulin faster aspart is a formulation of insulin aspart that contains two additional excipients: nicotinamide (vitamin b3) and l-arginine. nicotinamide is responsible for faster absorption by initially increasing aspart monomers in the subcutaneous deposit and producing a transient local vasodilator effect. l-arginine acts as a stabilizing agent. the main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the use of faster aspart on glycemic control in children and adolescents withdm1 treated with the integrated system. between july and october 2019, an analytical, longitudinal and prospective study was carried out with patients with dm1 under follow-up in the infant-juvenile diabetes units of the san pedro de alcántara (cáceres) and virgen del puerto (plasencia) hospitals. the inclusion criteria to be part of the study were: pediatric patients with a <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> of dm1, time of evolution of the disease greater than one year and previous treatment for at least three months with the integrated minimed 640g-smartguard system (medtronic, northridge , ca) using insulin aspart. real-time glucose monitoring (cgm) was performed with the guardian sensor 3 and the guardian link 3 transmitter (medtronic). initially, a download of the data recorded in the pump corresponding to the last month was carried out using the carelink software. for the next three months, the patients used faster aspart on the insulin pump. at the end of the study, the same variables recorded at the beginning were collected, as well as the problems or adverse events detected. of a total of 45 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 32 (17 women and 15 men) agreed to participate in the study, 81% pubescent, with a mean age of 13.49 ± 2.42 years and a mean evolution time of the disease of 7.0 ± 3.67 years. six patients who had not yet configured the predictive suspension before hypoglycemia on their pump kept this function deactivated during the study period, using only the previously established alarms. one participant dropped out of the study due to abdominal pain inconsistent with boluses. the comparative analysis of the data corresponding to the beginning of the study and the last month of use of faster aspart revealed a significant decrease in mean interstitial glucose that went from 149 ± 16 to 145 ± 14 mg / dl (p = 0.04). the results of the present study suggest that the accelerated absorption kinetics of faster aspart is associated, compared to aspart, with a significant improvement in glycemic control in patients with an integrated system, increasing the target time and decreasing the time in hyperglycemia, without increasing significantly the time in hypoglycemia. the adverse events reported at the end of the study corroborate the safety and good tolerance of faster aspart reported in other studies. the painful or burning sensation with boluses, the most frequently noted inconvenience in our study, had already been previously described. the lower effectiveness of corrective boluses compared to expectations has also been reported by some users, rethinking the suitability of modifying the active insulin time. other problems described were the appearance of bubbles when loading the reservoir and the need to change the infusion set more frequently. the latter, referred by a single patient, had already been reported previously, although a previous study determined a similar compatibility of aspart and faster aspart when used in csii.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer

low results for one patient involving the laboratory's dxi 800 access immunoassay analyzer (serial number (b)(4)). between january 2010 and july 2017, all vitamin b12 results, haematinics (hb) and full blood count (fbc) tests were within normal reference range. on (b)(6) 2017, vitamin b12 was 894 ng/l. [fbc was normal, hb was 131 g/l. mean corpuscular volume (mcv) had increased to 99 fl]. on (b)(6) 2018, no vitamin b12 test performed. [hb had fallen to 111g/l. mcv was 113fl and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (mch) was 39.2pg]. on (b)(6) 2018, vitamin b12 was 611 ng/l. [hb had fallen to 88g/l, plts 110, mcv 122 fl, mch 45.4pg]. on (b)(6) 2019 the vitamin b12 result was 289 ng/l. on (b)(6) 2019 the vitamin b12 result was 325 ng/l. on (b)(6) 2019 the vitamin b12 result was 167 ng/l. on (b)(6) 2020 the vitamin b12 result was 119 ng/l (result not questioned). this triggered the reflex ifab test which was positive (no data provided) and the customer suspected an ifab interference at that time for the previous higher results obtained. the access vitamin b12 reference range is 180 - 914 pg/ml. the customer reported that there was a delay in the <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> of pernicious anemia for one patient as a consequence of the erroneous access vitamin b12 results. the patient presented with pancytopenia and myelodysplastic syndromes which was initially thought to be the underlying cause as opposed to pernicious anemia. the patient received 18 months of chemotherapy because of the elevated access b12 results. no issues with sample integrity were reported by the customer. no hardware errors or other assay issues were reported in conjunction with this event. customer did not provide any data and the issue was too old for data recovery. unable to generate reagent udi. sample information such as sample collection tube used, centrifugation time an speed, storage or handling was not provided by the customer.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:the full patient identifier is case:(b)(6). the customer did not supply patient demographics such as age, date of birth, sex, weight, ethnicity or race. reagent lot was not supplied as the event was too old for data recovery. unable to obtain actual reagent manufacture date and to generate reagent udi. no hardware issues or other assay issues were reported in conjunction with this event by the customer. no issues with sample integrity were reported by the customer. no calibration, system check or quality control data was provided. there is no evidence to reasonably suggest that a malfunction occurred in conjunction with this event. although the exact cause of this event cannot be determined, an interference due to a high concentration of intrinsic factor antibodies in patient sample is suspected. per the vitamin b12 instructions for use, part number a89094 l, ¿approximately 50% of patients with pernicious anemia have intrinsic factor antibodies. the initial denaturation step in the access vitamin b12 assay inactivates intrinsic factor blocking antibodies. however, in very rare cases, some samples may not be inactivated due to the heterogeneity or extremely high titer of the intrinsic factor antibodies. such interfering antibodies may cause erroneous results. patients should be further evaluated if suspected of having these antibodies or if the vitamin b12 results are in conflict with other clinical or laboratory findings.¿ the customer acknowledged that the other haematology results (haemoglobin, platelets, mcv, etc.) in conjunction with a ¿normal¿ b12 should have indicated something other than cancer could be the case. the customer does not use beckman coulter haematology instrumentation or remisol to review haematology alongside the haematinics from the dxi. there was no <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> setup to help flag a potential issue prior to results leaving the laboratory. the root cause of

of the two erroneous results, the customer reported that one resulted in a delay of patient treatment. bec is attempting to gather additional information regarding the event. the investigation is ongoing. an updated report will be submitted once investigation is complete. bec internal identifier: (b)(4)..the customer reported that false negative results for urine rbc casts were generated on two samples run on their iq200 select urinalysis instrument. no flags were generated by instrument. the laboratory technician did not review the unclassified folder containing sample images and false erroneous results were released out of the lab. the customer reported that two erroneous patient results were released outside of the laboratory. of the two erroneous results, the customer stated that one caused delay of patient treatment. that sample was retested afterward, and the unclassified folder was reviewed and moderate red blood cell casts were seen in the urine sample. urine sample was cloudy and fresh. there were multiple attempts to acquire additional information regarding the allegation of delay of patient treatment from the customer. the customer stated he was not allowed to disclose information related to patient pre-existing conditions, <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> or treatment provided due to their hospital policies. however, he confirmed the doctor came to the lab the day the event occurred, and manually checked urine samples through microscope. the customer reported that that there was a delay of eight hours for patient treatment. an update regarding the patient condition was requested but not provided.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:please refer to investigation results section for investigation details..the customer contacted the customer technical support (cts) which directed him to update settings for formed particles in the unclassified (uncc) folder. it was noticed that the abnormal threshold in the instrument was set to 999 which is correct after instrument settings and logs were reviewed by subject matter expert (sme). the cts directed customer to set threshold to 0, so uncc for rbc casts particles will not be auto released, and technician must review them prior release. then computer was restarted, and customer will monitor and call back if necessary. additional information related to the instrument settings and a back up cd were gathered from the customer site and reviewed and analyzed by a bec application scientist and software engineer. the conclusion of the assessment is as follows: according to the iq200

Comments</b>:--.--.boston scientific received information that this patient passed away. the cause of death was not known. the field representative was looking at the arrhythmia logbook and had questions regarding why there were gaps in numbers indicating skipped episodes. boston scientific technical services (ts) discussed this was most likely due to non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (nsvt) which would be expected operation. one week later, the field representative contacted ts again to discuss that the physician suspects the device contributed to the patient's death since the autopsy results were negative and did not show a specific cause of death. the physician believes boston scientific <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>s, detection methods, or programming may lead to inappropriate delays in shock therapy for ventricular fibrillation (vf), which in turn causes the tissue to become ischemic, increasing the likelihood that the vf will continue and subsequent shocks will be less effective. the physician requested a detailed analysis of the episodes recorded on the date of death with particular attention paid to the first and last episodes as the physician believes that the time to shock therapy following failed treatment with anti-tachycardia pacing (atp) in the vf zone is too long. the physician was also questioning our sensing methods, indicating that while the rate/sense channel may show ventricular beats slower than the vf zone, the far field electrogram clearly shows vf. in one episode the physician notes where markers are showing a mix of vs, vt and vf yet the shock channel shows vf throughout the episode.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:(b)(4)..(b)(4). upon further review of the missing episode mentioned in the complaint, ts confirmed the episode was overwritten by the device. since the device did not have the most current software installed, this may have caused the device to retain the overwritten episode. this is not indicative of a malfunction of the device. the medical examiner returned the device and included was a letter requesting analysis and an investigational report which documents the patient's medical history of coronary artery disease with idiopathic cardiomyopathy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. the patient had complained of pain and swelling in his leg the night before he passed. no further information was provided. upon receipt at our post market quality assurance laboratory, a thorough evaluation of the device was performed. a review of the device memory log found no irregularities. a visual inspection of the device header and case noted no anomalies. the device was then exposed to simulated heart load conditions, and the defibrillation, pacing and sensing functions were tested. the device operated appropriately, according to its performance specifications, with no interruptions in therapy output or programmer communication at the returned programmed settings. a series of electrical tests was also performed, and again, normal device function was observed..the device memory was reviewed by boston scientific technical services (ts). all <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b>s appeared normal with varying r-wave amplitudes between 0.3-19.0 mv. since the device last reset in (b)(6) 2011, there were a total of (b)(4). the device was programmed with two vt zones. the vf zone was programmed to a 200 bpm rate cut off with atp (quick convert on) and shocks ((b)(4)). the vt zone was programmed with a 190 bpm rate cut off with atp (burst) and shocks ((b)(4)). the agc setting was programmed to 0.6 mv. the first episode on the date of death lasted 50 seconds. the ventricular sensed markers appeared to be 1:1 with r-waves on the rate/sense channel. immediately prior to the end of the charge there were 2 under-sensed beats, based on the decay rate of the agc. undersensing did not impact time to shock and the shock converted the patient. the last episode on the date of death lasted 57 seconds. the ventricular sensed markers were 1:1 with the r-waves on the rate/sense channel. the rate varied from below the vt zone rate cut off all the way into the vf zone. there was at least a 22 second onset before the device could declare an episode, due to the inability to satisfy detection. after declaring an episode, the rate varied widely. there was a 14 second duration between declaring onset and delivering therapy. atp therapy was delivered and converted the patient. ts determined that based on this assessment, the device functioned appropriately per normal design specifications.</p><hr><h3 id="ALG-DIAG-077">Result ALG-DIAG-077</h3><p><a

resynchronization therapy defibrillator (crt-d) had been in the hospital for a <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> cardiac catheterization procedure on november 6 and was discharged from the hospital on november 7. less than one hour after discharge, the patient went into ventricular tachycardia (vt) and received four bursts of anti-tachycardia pacing (atp), successfully converting the arrhythmia. seconds later, the patient went back into vt. the device inhibited therapy based on the rhythm onset being classified by the device as gradual. the rhythm slowed over the coming minutes to less than 170 bpm in the vt-1 (monitor only) zone. approximately three and a half minutes later the rhythm accelerated into the ventricular fibrillation (vf) zone and one burst of atp was delivered. the rhythm did not convert and a 41 joule shock was delivered by the device, converting the arrhythmia. however, the patient then went into a slow vt in the vt-1 zone, such that no therapy was programmed to be delivered. within one hour of these episodes, the patient was back in the emergency room with the resuscitation team. a magnet had been placed over the device to inhibit any therapy while the team worked on the patient. the patient subsequently died. there was concern that the delay to therapy contributed to the patient's demise. the device was not explanted for return and analysis. device data was submitted to technical services for review and engineering evaluation.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:technical services and engineering reviewed the episodes. the device <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> functioned as designed and the device operated as programmed. therapy was inhibited for this vt because the rhythm was classified as gradual, stable, and a < afib rate threshold. the rhythm was classified as gradual because the interval that was identified as the pivot interval was only 7 ms shorter than the previous interval. the interval where the rate actually transitioned to vt, which is three intervals earlier than the identified pivot interval, is not among the pivot interval candidates available to the onset <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>. the onset <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> begins its processing upon the third fast beat, at which time it seeds a buffer with the previous 11 intervals. intervals are accumulated in the buffer until episode start (8/10 fast), which is when the <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> classifies the rhythm as sudden or gradual. the pivot interval is selected as the interval with the largest decrease from its predecessor, however the six oldest and two newest intervals in the onset buffer are not candidates for the pivot interval. they are reserved for subsequent steps in the <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>, to calculate the pre-pivot average and the second phase interval. in this episode, the rate transition is among the first six intervals in the onset buffer, so it was not a candidate to be the pivot interval. the rate transition interval occurred a few beats prior to the end of the previous episode. when the previous episode ended, the detection windows were cleared. the next three vt beats signaled episode onset, initiating the onset <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> as described above. the pivot interval candidates were all similar in length such that the largest decrease was only 7 ms (335 minus 328), resulting in onset percent of only 1%, which led to gradual classification and inhibited therapy. the vt rate persisted for about 34 seconds after v-epsd start, therapy was inhibited and srd (programmed to 3 minutes) did not expire to override the inhibitors. therapy was not available when the rate dropped to the vt-1 monitor only zone, but was initiated when the rate accelerated to vf.</p><hr><h3 id="ALG-DIAG-079">Result ALG-DIAG-079</h3><p><a

intrathecal drug delivery systems (idds) continue to be used for management of chronic pain syndromes and spasticity resulting from an increasing number of pathologies. moreover, the therapeutic durability of these devices has been increasingly documented. with improved longevity, patients are undergoing an increased number of idds reservoir replacements for end of battery life. following any implant surgery, whether initial or revision, expedited management of unanticipated post-operative complications is of vital importance for improvement in patient outcomes. most commonly encountered is superficial cellulitis or surgical site infection (ssi), which requires immediate action to decrease the incidence of hardware involvement necessitating subsequent device explant. however, other less common etiologies need to remain on the differential <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> as not all erythematous rashes are infectious. as such, we present an uncommonly encountered case of postoperative erythema due to reticular telangiectatic erythema (rte) following an idds reservoir replacement. reported event: a (b)(6) male with prolonged history of chest wall and leg pain underwent a fifth idds reservoir replacement for end of battery life. the immediate post-operative care was unremarkable with the patient discharged from the hospital following planned overnight observation. routine ten-day post-operative clinic evaluation demonstrated a well approximated incision without signs of infection. on post-operative day 50, the patient contacted the pain management clinic via telephone indicating increasing erythema and warmth at the incision site, despite self-medication with oral (po) amoxicillin. the patient was evaluated in clinic the following day and ultimately sent to the emergency department with concerns for infection given physical exam demonstrating an erythematous and indurated pocket though without palpable fluid collection, incision drainage, or dehiscence. bedside ultrasonography (us) was negative for fluid collection. a computed tomography (ct) scan showed thickening of the skin overlying the reservoir without underlying abscess or fluid collection. labs were unremarkable with a normal white blood cell count (wbc) of 6.62 k/ul. the patient was admitted to the hospital for empiric intravenous (iv) antibiotics (vancomycin/ceftriaxone). infectious disease (id) was consulted and recommended a tenday outpatient course of cephalexin, which was continued for an additional five days when follow-up showed persistent erythema. he was reevaluated following completion of po antibiotics and readmitted to the hospital for iv vancomycin with concerns for ongoing hardware infection. however, repeat ct scan was again negative for pathology, wbc count remained normal at 6.31 k/ul, and the patient continued to deny systemic symptoms. moreover a completely healed and approximated incision remained present on physical exam. as such, the differential was expanded to include post inflammatory hyperpigmentation, contact dermatitis, allergic reaction, and rte. dermatology recommended a trial of triamcinolone to a small area of the erythematous patch for possible dermatitis; however, topical steroid treatment offered no resolution of symptoms. concern for allergic reaction was also considered though a medtronic representative confirmed there were no changes in the manufacturing process or materials between the patient¿s previous implant in 2013 and the present 2019 implant. thus, allergy was deemed unlikely, especially, given multiple prior idds replacements without issue. the patient was discharged two days later on expanded antibiotic coverage of amoxicillin-clavulanate and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (tmpsmx) with goal duration of 14 days per id recommendation. antibiotics were completed without clinical improvement in skin appearance and the patient remained without symptoms of systemic infection. outpatient dermatology evaluation led to a punch biopsy with pathology showing dilated vessels with lymphocytes and plasma cells in a perivascular distribution. no organisms were identified on biopsy thus dermatology felt results were not indicative of cellulitis, however, concern for false negative remained given prior antibiotic therapy. at a pain clinic follow-up, the patient reported profound hypopigmentation after local anesthetic with epinephrine during the biopsy. additionally, clinical exam at that time demonstrated ongoing blanching of the macular rash. ultimately, the <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> of rte, a benign reactive cutaneous manifestation associated with implantation of metallic devices, was concluded. the appearance of erythematous blanchable patches or plaques overlying an implanted device is suggestive of the pathology. given the appearance in our patient with similar cutaneous manifestations, having ruled out other more common pathologies, and continued lack of infectious symptoms off antibiotic therapy for greater than three weeks, other pathologies were excluded. clinical care going forward will consist of expected management of idds interrogation, refills, and reprogramming to control the patient¿s chronic pain symptoms. this project as described does not meet the criteria for human subject research and received exemption status. this case report highlights a post-operative erythema evaluation and management <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> as well as an uncommon, possibly underdiagnosed or underreported, pathology. this case in particular was challenging as the patient also had a second nonfunctioning silicone catheter tracking from the pocket to the intrathecal space. the decision to explant the idds reservoir and functional ascenda catheter due to infection would also necessitate explant of the old large diameter catheter, possibly with neurosurgery assistance for dural closure for prevention of persistent cerebrospinal fluid leak. for this particular case, a confluence of factors contributed to a delay in <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> that can hopefully be avoided in the future. first, the patient had multiple idds replacements without complication creating a bias toward persistent ssi. second, the implanting physicians had not encountered a case of rte previously. finally, evaluation and work up was completed on an outpatient rather than inpatient basis with coordination of care between id and dermatology, both of which had recommended device explant prior to rte being considered. however, the authors felt hardware involvement was unlikely with the lack of systemic symptoms, no evidence of deep wound infection on ct, and the well approximated incision.</p><p><b>Event

(2020). a rare case of tined lead migration of interstim device into the rectum with subsequent novel combined surgical-endoscopic removal technique. turkish journal of urology. 46(6): 492-5. doi: 10.5152/tud.2020.20320. summary: after the introduction of self-anchoring tined leads in 2002, lead migration after sacral neuromodulation (snm) in the form of interstimtm (medtronic, minneapolis, mn) has been reduced; however, it remains a considerable complication of this otherwise low-risk procedure. as intestinal perforation through lead migration or primary incorrect positioning portrays a rarity and has been scarcely reported in the literature, no <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> for explantation in such cases has been determined. we present a case of a young man with an snm device implant because of neurogenic urinary retention, who was admitted with inflammation, localized at the sacral lead insertion site. our <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> revealed a tined lead electrode protruding into the rectum without concomitant abscess. we performed an interdisciplinary surgical approach combining regular incisions over the sacrum and buttocks for dissection of the lead and the implanted pulse generator, respectively, with an endoscopic transanal lead extraction. this method prevented further bacterial seeding in the surrounding tissues of the colon and, therefore, presacral abscess formation or sacral osteomyelitis. combined surgical-endoscopic removal of the interstim device is an effective and safe procedure that should be included i reported event: 1. one male patient aged 25 years old, with an snm device implant because of neurogenic urinary retention, presented with significant right-sided sacral pain, inflammation, and ulceration, localized at the sacral lead insertion site. an anterior/posterior sacral x-ray was performed, in which a suspicious profound and medial projection of the right lead was noticed. comparing the current localization with the archived fluoroscopic images from the original implantation, a distinct migration of the right-sided lead was perceived. blood analysis showed no leukocytosis, with a slight rise of c-reactive protein. it was suspected a penetration of the rectum with a 2 cm protrusion of the right-sided quadripolar lead into the colonic lumen. a <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> sigmoidoscopy revealed a rectal wall perforation by the electrode 11 cm proximal to the anus. the right-sided pocket at the lateral buttocks was incised and the ipg extracted. the lead wire was dissected down to the fascia and cut sharply with scissors without extracting it through the sacral foramen. bacterial culture revealed colonization of the surgical site by escherichia coli and morganella morganii; blood cultures remained negative. oral antibiotics given. outpatient follow-up examinations 3 and 12 weeks later revealed no surgical site infection and no symptoms. on checking the record files retrospectively, it was found that patient had reported painful paresthesia at the right thigh immediately after the implantation, but after spontaneous resolution in a few days, no further investigations were done at that time.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:continuation of concomitant medical product(s): product id

physiologic stress testing. the device is intended for use in adult, adolescent, and children patient populations. the device is intended for use in a clinical setting by trained personnel under the supervision of a licensed physician. the device may interface with equipment including a treadmill or ergometer for dynamic exercise evaluation, as well as non-invasive blood pressure equipment, functional arterial oxygen saturation (spo2) equipment, and computer communications equipment. the customer declined to return the device for inspection, therefore a root cause into the reported

effectiveness of suture with a coating of triclosan on the dynamics of postoperative course in emergency surgical patients, comparing the postoperative period in the application of the suture with coating and without it. a total of 678 emergency surgery patients were divided into two groups: in group 1a (the control group), 386 patients (male 222 and female 164; age range: 18 to older than 60) underwent surgery on an emergency basis in 2005; in group 1b (active treatment group), 292 patients (male 161 and female 131: age range: 18 to older than 60) underwent emergency surgeries in 2015. the treatment and <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> were identical in both groups, with the exception of the use of a triclosan-coated sm (tsm); polydioxanone sutures (pds) plus (ethicon), monocryl plus (ethicon), and vicryl plus (ethicon) during all stages of surgery in the group 1b patients. in group 1b (active treatment group), reported complications included postoperative surgical site infections (ssis; n-41), surgical wound and abdominal cavity seromas (n-17), suppurations (n-6), wound and abdominal cavity infiltrates (n-12), gastrointestinal tract (git) suture failure (n-2) in which 1 patient underwent a forced relaparotomies, hyperthermia (n-54) and persistent leukocytosis (n-35). in conclusion, the use of tsm during emergency abdominal surgery facilitates a more favorable course of the early postoperative period in a statistically significant manner, which is expressed in earlier normalization of body temperature, hr, and laboratory

(b)(4)..this case involves an (b)(6) male in the (b)(6) with copd, atrial fibrillation, an indwelling urinary catheter, recurrent falls leading to hospitalizations and several other comorbid conditions who initially presented to (b)(6) hospital on (b)(6) 2020 with a fall, lymphopenia, elevated crp, and who was detected to have both influenza b and sars-cov-2 present in the nasopharynx using liat. of note, subsequent analysis of this liat result by roche shows abnormal growth curves and likely false positive detection of both influenza b and sars-cov-2. however, as a result of the positive liat test result for sars-cov-2, this patient was cohorted with other covid-19 positive patients. the patient was then treated for copd exacerbation (possibly with nebulizers with aerosolizing potential), bacterial infection (with antibiotics) and covid-19 (including the administration of remdesivir, oxygen, and steroids). the patient presumably clinically improved as he was discharged several days later on (b)(6) 2021. one week later (on (b)(6) 2021), this patient was readmitted after another fall and possibly hypotensive episodes and again cohorted with other covid-positive patients given presumed recent covid-19 infection on prior admission one week prior. initial covid-19 testing on admission yielded negative sars-cov-2 detection (altona platform); however, testing with a roche platform test on (b)(6) 2021 (6 days later) yielded a positive test for sars-cov-2. despite treatment with oxygen, antibiotics, and presumably other interventions, this patient expired on (b)(6) 2021 from primary diagnoses of bronchopneumonia and copd. the following medical assessment was provided: based on internal analysis, this case involves the false detection of both influenza b and sars-cov-2 on the liat platform. the allegation from the customer suggests that the false detection of sars-cov-2, specifically, may have contributed to the death of this patient due to subsequent decisions (based on this test result) to cohort the patient with other covid-19 positive patients during the initial and a subsequent hospital stay. according to our internal medical opinion document, for a false positive sars-cov-2 result: "individuals erroneously diagnosed with covid-19 may be subjected to targeted therapies for covid-19 with life-threatening side effects to bodily organs. a false-positive may lead to life-threatening deviations from standard clinical management <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>s. additionally, individuals may be cohorted with others who have sars- cov-2 infection and may contract the infection from them and suffer life threatening consequences or death." the probability of death in such a scenario has been determined to be rare with sporadic but not systematic occurrence. therefore, it is possible for a non-infected patient to acquire a life-threatening covid-19 infection if mistakenly cohorted with other infected patients. in this case, in order for the false positive liat sars-cov-2 result to have indirectly contributed to this patients death, several events need to have occurred. first, the patient must not have been infected with covid-19 on the initial hospital admission. second, the patient contracted covid-19 as a direct consequence of being cohorted with other covid-19 patients in the hospital. and third, the covid-19 infection was the contributary cause of death. several factors need to therefore be considered to better understand the probability of harm in this specific case. first, it is possible that the patient may have indeed had a true covid-19 infection upon arrival to the hospital for the initial admission. the liat yielded an erroneous result (although undetectable to the user) but to our knowledge no other testing was performed for covid-19 during the initial hospital admission. therefore, it is possible that the patient was infected to begin with although this appears to be less likely the case. second, if we assume that the patient was non-infected on admission and then subsequently contracted a covid-19 infection, there are many potential mechanisms for exposure. the patient may have directly contracted the infection from other covid-19 positive individuals inside or outside the cohort area through aerosolization if nebulizers were administered for copd or if ventilation systems were not enough to limit spread. the patient may also have been exposed by other healthcare workers anywhere in the hospital, inside or outside of the cohort area (e.g., emergency room, hallways, etc.). and finally, the patient may have contracted covid-19 in between hospital admissions while outside of the hospital. the cohorting of this patient with other covid-19 positive patients may or may not have been the critical factor that led to the exposure to sars-cov-2. and finally, this patient appears to have been treated for non-covid-19 related conditions such as copd and bacterial infections (receiving antibiotics during both hospital stays). it is possible that the primary cause of death was not covid-19 but rather some other medical condition. based on the information provided, the patient had a first true positive covid-19 positive result on (b)(6) 2021, which was over two weeks after the initial presentation and one week into the second hospital stay. two previous falls lead to two separate hospital admissions (the first with a false positive sars-cov-2 on admission and the second with a negative covid-19 test on admission). therefore, it seems plausible that the patient was suffering from life-threatening conditions other than covid-19 infection. all together, while it is possible that the false positive liat sars-cov-2 result may have indirectly contributed to the death of this patient, the cumulative probability of this happening seems very low considering the specific factors involved in this allegation. consideration needs to be given to many other equally plausible non-covid-19 related medical causes of death and/or sources of exposure to sars-cov-2 that are not related to the initially obtained liat test results an investigation to evaluate the customer issue is ongoing. a review of the data identified inefficient pcr leading to a late ct value and/or low amplification. a request has been made to return analyzer 13555 for further investigation. the customer issue has been alleged on the cobas liat system, product code: occ, catalog number 07341920190 and udi (b)(4). the test used on the cobas liat system is the cobas sars-cov-2 & influenza a/b test for use on the cobas liat system (eua(b)(4), product code: qjr). the product catalog number for the test is 09211101190 and the udi is (b)(4).

reported, through the research article titled ¿outflow graft tamponade- an under recognized cause of obstruction¿, the patient had an outflow graft obstruction. an audible precordial murmur in the right upper sternal border was heard. the patient also experienced low flow alarms. computed tomography (ct) scan showed severe diffuse distal obstruction with a cardiac index of 2.1. the patient was treated with a balloon dilation and surgical relief. the gortex graft was incised, and debris was seen. the patient sustained balloon rupture and detachment during percutaneous dilatation of the outflow graft leading to complete obstruction and cessation of left ventricular assist device (lvad) function with subsequent cardiac arrest, necessitating venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (va ecmo) and emergent pump exchange. during the study, a retrospective chart review of all patients that developed outflow graft tamponade between july 2011 and july 2020 was performed. of the 351 patients who underwent lvad implantation at the institution, 26 patients on lvad support were diagnosed with outflow graft tamponade. eight of those patients were implanted with heartmate 3 at the time (refer to mfr #'s 2916596-2024-05695, 2916596-2024-05700, 2916596-2024-05701, 2916596-2024-05688, 2916596-2024-05684, 2916596-2024-05682, 2916596-2024-05686). patients presented after a median duration of 862 days of support, range 327 days to 1455 days. at the time of presentation, 7 of the patients were in cardiogenic shock requiring vasopressors. all the patients were on aspirin and coumadin at the time of presentation. lactate dehydrogenase was on average 392 - 27 u/l (normal range: 140 to 280 u/l). the <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> of outflow graft tamponade was suspected in the presence of heart failure symptoms, an audible precordial murmur, abnormal invasive hemodynamics with relatively elevated filling pressures and a low cardiac output with an inability to appropriately improve them with increasing lvad speeds, and/or evidence of low flow lvad alarms/concerning changes in log file analysis. decrement in flow and power in the absence of speed changes raised the index of suspicion for outflow graft pathology limiting flow across the aortic anastomosis. right heart catheterization with hemodynamic lvad ramp studies were used to better characterize the hemodynamic significance. failure to decrease the mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and/or increase the cardiac output/flow with increases in lvad speed were indicative of pump malfunction. patients had a confirmed <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> via computed tomography angiography (cta) or direct visualization of obstruction in surgery. cardiothoracic surgeons described a gelatinous protein matrix that accumulates between the outflow graft and bend-relief. a frequently applied polytetrafluoroethylene (ptfe) covering the outflow graft was the leading cause of mechanical obstruction in this case series. no infectious etiology for outflow graft tamponade was found in operative samples sent at the time of outflow graft relief. the majority of individuals with interventions experienced functional improvement as assessed during subsequent outpatient visits.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:manufacturer's investigation conclusion: the reported outflow graft obstruction could not be conclusively confirmed through this investigation as no images were provided by the account and no product was returned for evaluation. a direct correlation between the left ventricular assist device (lvad) device and the reported events could not be conclusively determined through this evaluation. additionally, the reported low flow alarms could not be confirmed as no log files were submitted for evaluation. the research article titled ¿outflow graft tamponade- an under recognized cause of obstruction¿, reported the following information: the purpose of this study was to develop an optimal <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> for the <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> and treatment of lvad-related outflow graft tamponade by understanding a single centers experience. a retrospective chart review of all patients that developed outflow graft tamponade between july 2011 and july 2020 was performed. this patient was implanted with a heartmate (hm) 3 as a destination therapy. the patient experienced low flow alarms, a murmur, and a severe diffuse distal obstruction with a cardiac index of 2.1. the patient was treated with a balloon dilation and surgical relief. the patient experienced cardiac arrest, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and emergent pump exchange. this study concluded that outflow graft tamponade is an under recognized form of outflow graft obstruction. surgical relief of outflow graft tamponade results in normalization of lvad function and can be performed safely. larger multicenter studies with longer follow-up are needed to determine the true incidence of this finding and to clarify the optimal strategies for <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> and management. the serial numbers or other identifying information of the products were not reported and were not able to be determined during the investigation. the heartmate (hm) 3 left ventricular assist system (lvas) instructions for use (ifu), rev. c and the hm 3 patient handbook, rev. d are currently available. section 1 of the ifu, ¿introduction¿, lists cardiac arrythmia as an adverse event that may be associated with the use of the hm 3 lvas. additionally, section 6, "patient care and management", lists arrhythmia as a potential late postimplant complication that may be associated with the use of the hm3 lvas. this section also addresses all pump parameters, including pump flow. section 4, ¿system monitor¿, describes the pump flow display and the hazard alarms. the ifu states that per design, when the estimated flow value is calculated at less than 2.5 liters per minute (lpm), a low flow status is posted to the log file. if the flow remains below 2.5 lpm for 10 seconds, a low flow hazard alarm is triggered. this section also explains that changes in patient condition can result in low flow. section 5 contains information regarding the preparation and attachment of the sealed outflow graft. this section instructs the user to verify that the graft is not twisted or kinked by checking the position of the black line on the graft above and below the bend relief and ensuring that the line is straight. this section warns that failure to connect the bend relief so that it is fully and evenly connected can allow kinking and abrasion of the graft, which may lead to serious adverse events such as low left ventricular assist device flow and/or bleeding. section 7 of the ifu, "alarms and troubleshooting", and section 5 of the patient handbook, "alarms and troubleshooting", address all system alarm conditions as well as the appropriate actions associated with each condition. furthermore, section 8 of the patient handbook, ¿handling emergencies¿, also provides examples of emergencies and the proper actions to take in the event an emergency occurs. no further information was provided. the manufacturer is closing the file on this event..section b3: event date estimated.

is a retrospective review of patients who presented for the evaluation and management of mandibular fracture nonunion from january 1, 2007 through july 31, 2017. during the study period, 18 patients with mandibular fracture nonunion were identified. the sample¿s mean age was 43.4 18.8 years and 11.1% were women. most patients (83.3%) were treated with open reduction and internal fixation (orif) for their initial mandibular injury. mean length of follow-up was 13.3 20.4 months. it was not specified or mentioned which patient or if any or all of the patients received a synthes plate. however, there are several photographs included in the article that could indicate that synthes plates were possibly used: for the single stage approach group, there were 3 cases listed as any complication, 1 case of malocclusion, 1 case of trismus, 1 case removal of hardware, and 1 case of donor site hematoma. for the 2 stage approach group, 2 cases were listed as any complication, 1 case of infection, 1 case of malocclusion. a (b)(6) man who was assaulted and sustained a left mandibular angle fracture. this was treated with orif using the champy technique. the patient was subsequently lost to follow-up but returned 6 months later with exposed hardware, nonunion of the left angle fracture, and an intraoral wound. he underwent removal of hardware and debridement of nonviable bone, which resulted in a 3-cm bony defect. a medial femoral condyle corticocancellous bone flap with a cuff of vastus medialis muscle was performed for singlestage reconstruction of this defect. a (b)(6) man sustained left parasymphysis and right body fractures from assault. he underwent orif of the 2 fractures and imf. however, the patient was noncompliant and removed his interdental wires and continued to use chewing tobacco. he subsequently developed intraoral wound dehiscence, nonunion, and infection of the 2 fracture sites. preoperative computed tomogram depicted left angle nonunion with loose hardware. he returned to the operating room for removal of hardware, debridement, and removal of the right mandibular first, second, and third molars through an intraoral approach. the patient was placed in intermaxillary fixation (imf) and was treated with 6 weeks of parenteral antibiotic for osteomyelitis. his intraoral wounds eventually healed, and final reconstruction was performed through an extraoral approach with a computer-assisted design and computer-assisted manufacturing (cad/cam) fabricated patient-specific reconstruction plate and iliac crest bone grafting. he went on to achieve successful union of his mandibular fractures. a (b)(6) man who sustained a left mandibular body fracture from a fall and was initially managed with orif at another institution. this was complicated by intraoral hardware exposure and fracture nonunion. of note, there was a large intraoral soft tissue defect present. he was taken to the operating room and underwent removal of hardware, debridement of necrotic bone, and placement of an external fixator because of poor dentition that did not allow for adequate imf. however, the intraoral wound persisted, and necrotic bone was still visible 2 months after debridement. at that point, a free iliac crest bone flap with a cuff of internal oblique muscle was used for bony and soft tissue reconstruction with the assistance of virtual surgical planning. the patient went on to heal uneventfully and eventually had successful placement of dental implants. this report is for the (b)(6) man who had exposed hardware, nonunion of the left

notes dated (b)(6) 2018 indicate the patient presented to the hospital with a chief complaint of blue toe syndrome. the records state: ¿46 year old woman who comes today for evaluation of painful 1st and 4th toes. onset of pain was acute about 30 days ago. at the same time, she developed bluish discoloration. this has worsened since then. no fever. mild claudication in both legs. long standing history of smoking (30 years, at least 10 cigarettes/day). she also has history of coronary artery disease, with healed myocardial infarction, as well as chronic systolic heart failure.¿ the (b)(6)

atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta with near occlusive thrombus, and small non healing ulcer in left 1st toe. this has caused distal arterial embolization into the left 1st and 4th toes. options for management discussed including continuation of medical management with or without anticoagulation or an intervention. decision made to proceed with intervention. will offer endograft stent as attempt to exclude this large thrombus, which is the source of embolization.¿ actual ct angiogram images have not been received. the (b)(6) 2018 progress notes continue: ¿plan: await result of cardiac nuclear stress test to determine her risk of perioperative coronary ischemia. then, if ok, schedule patient for endograft stent placement in abdominal aorta and possible both common iliac arteries.¿ ¿risks, alternatives and benefits of procedure were explained to the patient. all questions answered. consent obtained. risks include death, bleeding, infection, stroke, renal failure, embolization, edema, nerve damage, possible reoperation, thrombosis, embolization, limb loss, among others. patient understands and is willing to proceed.¿ stress test records dated (b)(6) 2018 indicate the patient underwent a nuclear stress test as part of pre-operative evaluation. the stress test records state: ¿conclusion: 1) probably abnormal nuclear stress test. 2) reversible perfusion defect that is relatively small but is quite definite, at the tip of the apex. 3) suggestion of a larger partially reversible perfusion defect of the inferior wall. this is suggested, but this is [sic] not quite

claudication. she does still continue to smoke, although she is interested in smoking cessation. she has smoked for well over 25 years. she states she does not ever smoke more than a pack a day. usually about a half a pack. she has documented dyslipidemia.¿ history and physical notes dated (b)(6) 2018 state: ¿initial assessment and plan: 1) preoperative assessment prior to undergoing endograft repair of near occlusive thrombus in the distal abdominal aorta with associated atherosclerosis of the native arteries. the patient had abnormal noninvasive risk assessment suggestive of possible multivessel ischemia. i recommended the patient undergo a coronary angiogram and possible percutaneous intervention if indicated. 2) ongoing tobacco abuse. we did start the patient on chantix starter and continuation pack. 3) history of near occlusive thrombus of the distal abdominal aorta. the patient does need possible endograft placed. 4) longstanding history of hypothyroidism. 5) dyslipidemia, on statin therapy. 6) history of alcohol consumption. no prior history of alcohol withdrawal symptoms.¿ operative records dated (b)(6) 2018 indicate the patient underwent ¿1) placement of covered stent in abdominal aorta. 2) placement of covered stents in bilateral common iliac arteries. 3) advancement of tip of catheter from both common femoral arteries to abdominal aorta. 4) radiological supervision and interpretation of placement of stent in abdominal aorta. 5) ultrasound guidance for identification of bilateral common femoral arteries, with real time guidance for access of bilateral common femoral arteries, with documentation and report.¿ operative records dated (b)(6) 2018 state: ¿ultrasound was used to identify bilateral common femoral arteries. under ultrasound guidance, we obtained access with needle, followed by 0.035 inch guidewires. then, we advanced a 6-french sheath bilaterally and performed preclosure with perclose devices x2 for each common femoral artery. eight-french sheaths were then exchanged and then we advanced kumpe catheters, which allowed us to advance 0.035 inch lunderquist guidewires from both common femoral arteries to the descending thoracic aorta. then, a 12-french sheath was advanced from the left common femoral artery to abdominal aorta and a 16- french sheath was advanced from the right common femoral artery to abdominal aorta. a 5-french pigtail marker catheter was advanced then from the left common femoral artery to abdominal aorta. we obtained abdominal aortic angiogram.¿ actual ultrasound images have not been received. the (b)(6) 2018 operative records continue: ¿we then used a main body gore excluder endoprosthesis, reference number rlt231212, serial number (b)(4). this was deployed in the abdominal aorta below the renal artery takeoff and extended down into the left common iliac artery. then, another stent was placed in the right common iliac artery to complete the modular bifurcated prosthesis. this was a contralateral limb gore excluder device, reference number pll161007, serial number (b)(4). this covered the left common iliac artery. as stated above, the main body extending from the abdominal aorta into the right common iliac artery. reliant balloon was then advanced for angioplasty post deployment as well as 10 mm balloon for kissing balloon angioplasty at the level of the aortic

(isi) field service engineer (fse) was dispatched to the customer site to further investigate the reported event. based on the field evaluation, this reported event was not confirmed. the fse test drove the system and could not replicate the reported issue. the system was tested and verified as ready for use. the complaint was not confirmed based on the field evaluation. an investigation was completed to determine the cause of this reported event by an intuitive surgical, inc. (isi) failure analysis engineer (fae). based on review of the state logs, shape logs, and vision probe feed by an ion system analyst and an ion medical imaging engineer, at two separate occurrences during the procedure, the vision probe was not detected as being fully seated prior to the user beginning driving. the stripe detect <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> processes and sends the updated orientation to the user interface once the proximal probe sensor signal drops, indicating that the probe is fully seated. from the logs, it was observed that the user began driving before the proximal probe sensor signal dropped and before the stripe detect occurred. in the first occurrence, the user drove for approximately 45 seconds without the vision probe being fully seated. in the second occurrence, the user drove for approximately 1.5 minutes without the vision probe being fully seated. because the vision probe was re-inserted into a different orientation within the catheter that was 90 degrees off from the previous configuration for both occurrences, the motion commanded was unintuitive until the vision probe was detected as being fully seated and the <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> was triggered to then reflect the updated orientation. stripe detect outputted the correct orientation when it was triggered. per user manual 553990: "when inserting the vision probe through the catheter, the system will detect the color stripes inside the catheter to ensure vision is oriented correctly while driving. if the stripes are not visible, a message appears when the vision probe reaches the catheter tip. the message indicates that orientation was not accurately detected and instructs user to partially retract the vision probe until the stripes inside the catheter are clearly visible, and then reinsert the vision probe through the catheter. always make sure the vision probe tip is clean. if the system does not present the message because it did not detect the stripes (or if it detects the stripes incorrectly), the vision probe image will appear to be 90 or 180 degrees rotated, and driving will be non-intuitive. in this case, partially retract the vision probe until the stripes inside the catheter are clearly visible, and then reinsert the vision probe through the catheter." note that log data cannot be used to confirm the occurrence or cause of a pneumothorax.</p><hr><h3 id="ALG-DIAG-169">Result ALG-DIAG-169</h3><p><a

death</p><p><b>Event Main Comments</b>:on (b)(6) 2016, this (b)(6)-year-old caucasian male patient with a past medical history of accelerated hypertension, idiopathic thrombocytopenia, hypercholesterolemia and pancytopenia secondary to bone marrow hypo cellularity presented to the hospital. the patient was reported as having no recent history of tobacco, alcohol or drug abuse. the patient was admitted to hospital due to worsening dyspnoea on exertion whilst running, flushing of the face, chest pain and diaphoresis. the patient also reported experiencing dryness and slight tightness in his throat as well as generalized weakness. the patient's symptoms were reported as having begun four (4) days prior to admission. on admission, the reporter stated that the patient was afebrile with oxygen saturation 88% and blood pressure 148/74. a computed tomography (ct) angiogram of the chest showed evidence of extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli (pe), trace pericardial fluid and mildly emphysematous and hyper-inflated lungs. the patient was initially treated with enoxaparin (dosage not reported). the patient was subsequently diagnosed with bilateral submassive pe and right ventricular dysfunction with right ventricular/left ventricular ratio of 1.33 and enrolled into the (b)(6) clinical study on (b)(6) 2016. on (b)(6) 2016, the patient underwent treatment with the ekosonic endovascular catheter for pulmonary embolism, with selective placement of ekos catheters in the right main pulmonary, right lower lobe pulmonary, left main pulmonary and left lower lobe pulmonary arteries. it was reported that on (b)(6) 2016, the patient was noted to have acute onset of right lower facial droop and right-sided weakness. a ct of the brain performed without contrast showed left-sided parenchymal haemorrhage involving the left frontoparietal convexity with slight subarachnoid extension measuring 34 mm. the patient was exhibiting slurring of speech. the patients' blood pressure was reported as being labile, ranging from 116/57 to 181/92. on (b)(6) 2016, a repeat ct of the brain performed without contrast showed evolving parenchymal hematoma in the left frontoparietal convexity with small surrounding edema. the size of the hematoma had increased since the prior ct performed on (b)(6) 2016 (size not reported) but appeared stable. an mri of the brain showed the subject had cavernous malformation or possible acute haemorrhage. laboratory results included inr 1.1 and ptt 33.7 sec. the patient's anticoagulation therapy was suspended. the patient underwent thorough <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> evaluation; however, no obvious underlying cause for the intracranial haemorrhage (ich) could be identified. the reported stated that the ich most likely was due to the systemic effect of anticoagulation and probable intravenous thrombolysis. on (b)(6) 2016, the patients slurring of speech was reported as having improved with physical therapy and the patients' left frontoparietal haemorrhage appeared to be stable. on (b)(6) 2016, the patient underwent 2d echo which revealed questionable right atrial thrombus. the patient's status was reported as alert and following commands with no focal neurological deficit. anticoagulation therapy was not administered due to ich which was reported as slowly improving. on (b)(6) 2016, the patient's condition was reported as remaining clinically stable, he was ambulatory and discharged to rehab. the patient commenced physical therapy at the rehabilitation facility (b)(6) 2016, the reporter stated that the patient was able to participate in evaluation procedures without and c/o pain or discomfort. assessment of the patients 'hand held' gait technique was performed with the patient ambulating 100ft prior to being assisted back into his wheelchair. the patient stated that 'it felt good to walk with hand held x2 instead of an 'rw' as it felt more natural' (verbatim). as the patient continued to speak the physical therapist noted that the patient's eyes 'gazed to the left' and that the patient slumped into the wheel chair and began to experience a 'seizure' (time noted as approximately 08:45). a tongue depressor was provided for the patient during the seizure due to biting activity. a nurse was called and whilst the staff were arriving to assist, the patient was reported to have responded to staff asking if he was alright by saying 'ok'. however, shortly thereafter, the patient experienced a further seizure. the patient was transferred to a hospital bed and transferred to the care of the registered nurses. oxygen was administered to the patient using a nasal cannula (3l/min). the patient became unresponsive and displayed 'agonal type' breathing and due to this the patient was ambu bagged. a 22 gauge iv was inserted and the patient's labs were recorded as v/s 111/55, 80, 78% o2 saturation, multiple attempts were made unsuccessfully to capture the patients ekg. an artificial airway was inserted with the patient's oxygen saturation recorded as 98% post insertion. a non-breather mask was placed, the patients' blood sugar levels were reported as 166, bp 101/57, pulse 107 and o2 saturation 87%. infusion of normal saline was commenced at 08:58. at 09:00 the patients oxygen saturation was reported as 97% and pulse at 54, at this time, the artificial airway was removed. the patient was transported by ems to the er, during transfer cardio pulmonary resuscitation (cpr) was started by ems. ems reported patient pulse was absent during transit and cardiac rhythm was asystole and v-tach. there was brief return of spontaneous circulation on arrival at the hospital. the patient was diagnosed with cardiac arrest and resuscitation was continued in accordance with acls (advanced cardiovascular life support) <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>s with a central venous catheter placement in the right femoral vein. cpr was continued for 30 minutes without return of pulse. the time of death was reported as 10:01 am. an autopsy was not performed as the patients family requested this not be performed.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer

harm. root cause review: a definitive root cause can be attributed to the off-label use of the device, when the device is used outside its stated intended use it may lead to outcomes that were never intended to happen and were never studied. it can be noted that as per the instructions for use that migration, perforation and obstruction of the pancreatic duct are known potential complications. summary: the complaint is confirmed based on customer testimony. for stent migration in the endoscopic ultrasound drainage (eud) group: in one patient, the endoprosthesis migrated inside the pseudocyst and required endoscopic extraction. in the conventional transenteric drainage (ctd) group: in one patient, late double-pigtail stent migration resulted in small-bowel perforation requiring a limited small-bowel resection. a second migrated double-pigtail stent was removed from the rectosigmoid during sigmoidoscopy. for drainage failure in the endoscopic ultrasound drainage (eud) group: endoscopic drainage failed in four patients. two of these underwent percutaneous drainage, one underwent surgery, and one patient declined any further therapy. in the conventional transenteric drainage (ctd) group: of the four failures, two underwent percutaneous drainage and one underwent surgery, while one declined further intervention. complaints of this nature will continue to be monitored for potential emerging trends..investigation is still pending. a follow up mdr will be submitted to include the investigation conclusions.</p><hr><h3 id="ALG-DIAG-174">Result

metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma which is an msskras mutant and has received 14 cycles of irmdg in (b)(6) 2023. it should be remarked that the crossmatch test is usually one of the multiple compatibility tests carried. prior to the crossmatch test, a battery of tests as abo-rh typing, antibody screening and antibody identification should be performed to ensure the suitability of the blood. therefore, the suitability of the blood to be transfused to the patient should be ensured before the crossmatch test and any incompatibility should be already found. if the patient's antibody is too weak to detect the weak antigen on the donor's rbcs it is unlikely to cause a serious immediate reaction in the patient and will probably only cause a mild hemolytic transfusion reaction if the patient's immune response is stimulated. therefore, it cannot be completely ruled out that the symptoms experienced by the patient could have been due to the underlying condition and status of the patient. additionally to all mentioned before, no significant differences in the reaction pattern obtained were observed between the pre-transfusion crossmatch test (sample (b)(4) with blood bag (b)(6) and the second test carried out after the transfusion (sample (b)(4) with blood bag (b)(6). therefore, once again cannot be confirmed that the reaction could be attributed to the incorrect result but to the underlying condition of the patient. a review of the device history record (dhr) of the affected lot of dg gel anti-igg lot: 23016.01 was performed. it was confirmed that no incidents were reported during the production process of this lot that could have caused the reported event. likewise, quality control (qc) record for the mentioned dg gel anti-igg lot: 23016.01 does not show incidents and all tests performed met the acceptance criteria (specificity for positive and negative samples and potency test) specifically for dat and iat. the log files of the instrument

barely visible small sized agglutinated cells at the lower part of the gel column or barely visible scattered points throughout the gel column along with a pellet of non-agglutinated cells at the bottom, may signal either specific or unspecific reactions. these reaction patterns can be classified as negative or as "doubtful" by the automated instruments without indicating any malfunction. these cases are at the limit of the system sensitivity. the following limitation has been included in erytra eflexis instructions for use (ifu) in section 1.3 product limitations: "results that are

new step in the <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>."    literature summary this prospective study aimed to evaluate the <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> yield of ebus-guided mediastinal cryobiopsy (ebus-mcb) in patients with non<b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> rapid on-site evaluation (rose). secondary aims included an assessment of the safety of the procedure. a total of 46 patients were included. of the 46 cases where ebus-mcb was performed, a definite <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> was achieved in 33 (71.7%) cases. of the 32 cases with a non<b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> rose, ebus-mcb confirmed the <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> in 19 (59.3%) cases. thus, the additive <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> yield of ebus-mcb over ebus-tbna was in 14/32 cases (43.7%). the additional time required for performing cryobiopsy in the study was 11 ± 2 minutes. background: endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (ebus-tbna) is considered the investigation of choice for sampling mediastinal nodes. a major drawback of ebus-tbna is its lower <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> yield for lymphoma and benign diseases. ebus-guided mediastinal cryobiopsy (ebus-mcb) is a novel technique that provides larger nodal biopsy samples, with an acceptable safety profile. this study aimed to evaluate the <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> yield of ebus-mcb in patients with an inconclusive rapid on-site evaluation (rose). methods: this is a prospective study of patients who underwent ebus-tbna for undiagnosed mediastinal lymphadenopathy. patients in whom rose did not yield a <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> (non<b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> rose) or rose revealed scanty atypical cells (inadequate rose) were subjected to ebus-mcb. the <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> yield, adequacy, and complications of ebus-mcb were analyzed. results: of the 196 patients undergoing ebus-tbna, 46 patients underwent ebus-mcb. thirty-two cases underwent ebus-mcb for a non<b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> rose. ebus-mcb confirmed the <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> in 19/32 (59.3%) cases. the additive <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> yield of ebus-mcb over ebus-tbna was 43.7% (14/32 cases). in all 14 cases where ebus-mcb was performed for an inadequate rose, the material obtained by ebus-mcb was adequate for ancillary studies. minor bleed was noted in 13/46 cases, which settled with conservative measures. one case had a moderate bleed, requiring a cryoextraction of the blood clot from the airways. conclusion: ebus-mcb has a <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> yield of 59.3% when performed in cases with a non<b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> ebus-rose. the

vessel perforation. publication: clinical case reports (b)(4). title: unrecognized perforation into the anterior interventricular vein complicating pci for anterior stemi: an unexpected detour excerpt: an 84-year-old man with history of end-stage renal disease and remote kidney transplant (18 years prior) developed acute crushing chest pain and was brought to our emergency department by emergency medical services with a <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> of anterior stemi based upon electrocardiogram (ecg) obtained in the field. repeat ecg (figure 1) confirmed the <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b>. on examination, he was hemodynamically stable but uncomfortable due to chest pain. he was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for emergent coronary angiography. angiography revealed severe three-vessel atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (cad), including nonculprit high grade obstructive lesions in the proximal right and mid-circumflex coronary arteries, as well as a culprit complete occlusion of the mid-lad immediately distal to an aneurysmal segment of the vessel that also gave rise to a large diagonal branch (video s1 & figure 2). repeated attempts were made to primarily wire the lad using a runthrough workhorse wire (terumo medical); however, this was unsuccessful as the wire was constantly deflected into the diagonal branch (video s4). microcatheter-supported wiring using a fine cross mg (terumo medical) was unsuccessful as well (video s2). attempts at wiring the lesion using a hydrophilic tapered wire (fielder-xt; asahi intecc usa) and a polymer jacketed wire (pilot 50: abbott vascular) supported by a stiffer microcatheter (corsair; asahi intecc usa) also failed. an emergent multidisciplinary team meeting was called between a cardiac surgeon, the interventional cardiologist, and the patient's inpatient cardiologist. all physicians agreed that due to the patient's age, frailty, and comorbidities he was not a surgical candidate. the patient continued to experience severe chest pain despite aggressive analgesic administration with clear st-elevations still present on ecg. given the extensive calcific disease appreciated on his angiograms, it was hypothesized that treating the lesion as a chronic total occlusion (cto) and proceeding with an antegrade wire escalation strategy might prove successful. ultimately, the lesion appeared to be crossed using a controlled drilling technique with a miracle brothers 3 wire (asahi intecc usa) (video s3). the microcatheter was advanced into the distal vessel and intraluminal position was confirmed via a distal tip injection (video s4). of note, in this high acuity situation, the operators' focus was mistakenly restricted to the fact that the wire appeared to be intravascular, and the unusual appearance of the vessel was not appreciated at this time. on retrospective review after the case, the distal vessel clearly displays "to-and-fro" flow with drainage into the coronary sinus along with medial and lateral branches that are different in appearance from typical lad septal and diagonal branch vessels. these unrecognized findings are all hallmarks of the distal vessel being a cardiac vein (specifically the aiv), rather than the lad. as the operators believed that the microcatheter had crossed into the distal lad, the distal vessel was then safely wired using a workhorse wire to allow for equipment delivery. due to challenging equipment delivery, a 1.5 x 12 mm compliant balloon was used to predilate the lesion followed by a 2.0 x 15 mm compliant balloon. a subsequent angiogram revealed extensive contrast extravasation from the vessel leading to the <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> of cap (video s5). salvage techniques for cap were initiated according to the standard perforation care <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> detailed in figure 3,4 although protamine administration was deferred. balloon tamponade was attempted utilizing the 1.5 mm balloon already in the vessel, followed by immediate upsizing to a 2.0 mm balloon that was inflated in the proximal vessel, with repeat angiograms showing no persistent contrast extravasation. transthoracic echocardiography was performed, revealing no evidence of a pericardial effusion. repeat injections performed during transient balloon deflations revealed continued extravasation of contrast. obtaining an additional arterial access site for the purpose of utilizing dual-guide catheter ("ping-pong guides") technique was discussed; however, this was deferred given the previous challenge crossing the lesion initially. at this time, the patient developed vomiting, hypotension, and ultimately ventricular fibrillation requiring multiple defibrillations and chest compressions. he was intubated emergently and cardiac anesthesia performed transesophageal echocardiography, which showed no evidence of pericardial effusion, but an akinetic anterior wall of the left ventricle. an intra-aortic balloon pump (iabp) was simultaneously inserted through the right femoral artery, and the patient was started on norepinephrine with resultant stabilization of his hemodynamics. selective lad angiography performed through a guide catheter extension demonstrated phasic flow in the distal vessel as well as a channel connecting the mid-vessel and cs, which was thought to represent an iatrogenic arteriovenous fistula (avf) (video s6). the operators believed the etiology for these findings to be two separate wire perforations, with one perforation into the coronary sinus and one into the pericardial space. advancement of a covered stent across the mid-vessel was not possible, so a 2.5 x 20 mm drug eluting stent (des) was advanced and deployed across the perforation to permit tracking of a covered stent. angiography following des deployment revealed timi 3 flow in the distal vessel for the first time during the case, with continued robust flow into the cs through multiple channels. additionally, an unusual "myocardial blush pattern" was observed as well as extensive flow into the coronary veins (video s7). a 2.8 x 16 mm graftmaster covered stent (abbott vascular) was deployed across the visualized perforation; however, a residual channel connecting the vessel and the cs was visualized distal to the covered stent (video s8). a second 2.8 x 16 mm covered stent was placed across the remaining channel and postdilated, effectively closing the perforation with no further flow visualized into the cs. final angiograms also revealed several small contained wire perforations, persistence of the unusual "myocardial blush pattern" and even more robust filling of the major cardiac veins (video s9 & figure 4). post-procedure lv systolic function remained severely diminished, with an ejection fraction of 15%. he remained hemodynamically stable with an iabp in place on low dose norepinephrine and dobutamine. he went on to develop oliguric renal failure, and after multiple discussions with his wife surrounding goals of care, comfort measures were pursued and he died due to cardiogenic shock on post-procedure day four.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:manufacturing site: manufacturing site could not be identified because the product lot number information was not available. device evaluation could not be performed because the affected device was not returned from the user facility. lot history records review could not be conducted because lot information was unavailable. according to the literature and referring to known similar events, the reported vessel perforation in this case was most likely associated with patient anatomy and procedural contents. although lot history records review could not be conducted, all the shipped products were inspected in the production process and satisfied the product specifications and release criteria; therefore, it was concluded that there was no anomaly in product quality. no capa will be taken. instructions for use (ifu) states: observe movement of this guide wire in the vessels. before this guide wire is moved or torqued, the tip movement should be examined and monitored under fluoroscopy. do not move or torque the guide wire without observing corresponding movement of the tip; otherwise, the guide wire may be damaged and/or trauma may occur. in addition, ensure that the distal tip of this guide wire and its location in the vessel are visible during manipulations of the guide wire. use this guide wire carefully as the guide wire may penetrate the blood vessel. otherwise, it may cause adverse events such as blood vessel perforation and coronary artery dissection. the higher torque performance, stiffer distal end, and/or higher advancement force may present a higher risk of perforation or injury than if using a more flexible guide wire. therefore, use the most flexible guide wire that will treat the lesion (i.e., the guide wire with the smallest tip load that will treat the lesion), and take due care to minimize the risk of perforation or other damage to blood vessels.

decreasing egvs. the system did not suggest basal insulin while egvs were below 60 mg/dl and only suggested basal insulin while egvs were below target when a sharp increase in egvs was predicted, which is expected behavior of the system. the agc <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> was able to appropriately adapt the suggested insulin based on egvs and user inputs. logs showed constant

Comments</b>:it was reported to siemens that on (b)(6) 2019 a patient with indeterminate pelvic pain underwent a <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> ct scan using the somatom drive system. because the patient has two prosthetic hip implants, the user performed an imar reconstruction of the ct raw data to reduce image artifacts caused by metal. this imar-reconstruction imaging suggested that the titanium portion of one hip implant was broken. based on the imar-reconstruction imaging, it was decided that surgery to replace the apparently broken prosthetic hip implant would be performed. during the surgery on (b)(6) 2019, it was discovered that the hip implant was not broken. the surgeon opted to replace the implant anyway during the surgery. post-surgically, the patient suffered from delayed wound healing. additional details regarding the patient's health status were not provided to siemens. because of the obviously incorrect initial <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b>, the user decided to scan the explanted hip prosthetic with the imar-<b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> again and to check the normal reconstruction (without imar) of the raw data taken before the surgery. both images did not show any broken metal parts. the event was reported to siemens on october 18, 2019. the reported event occurred in (b)(6).</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:(b)(6). siemens has completed a technical investigation of the reported event. siemens reviewed the imar series images and concluded that the prothesis appeared to be broken. the review of the non-imar series images revealed the prothesis as being intact. metal strongly attenuates the x-ray beam. hence, image quality can be degraded significantly by photon starvation and/or beam hardening. imar is a correction <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> that is intended to recover image information that is lost because of the metal objects. imar can reconstruct information in the image, especially when it is located further away from the metal object. regions that are mostly surrounded by metal (such as the inner area of the acetabular component of the hip implant) cannot be recovered without artifacts. additionally, the <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> can potentially create artifacts by itself. this effect is known and cannot technically be avoided. siemens healthcare recommends the use of conventional recon without imar for additional <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> imaging when using imar. siemens som7 default imar protocols (e.g. hip_imar_ir protocol) contain all recon jobs twice: with imar and without imar. furthermore, in section 6 of the associated user manual, there is a special note that recommends reviewing an imar image series in conjunction with a non-imar image series for a side-by-side comparison to detect possible introduced artifacts. in conclusion, both the default imar protocols and the user manual, remind the experienced user that imar image series should be read in conjunction with a respective non-imar image series to avoid misinterpretation. the reported somatom drive system performs as expected and meets specification.</p><hr><h3

rate 80, 4th pass: fluence 60 / rate 80. post lasing angiography revealed a significant increase in blood flow across the occlusion with lumen size increased to approximately 4.0 mm. post lasing further intervention was performed utilizing a 6.0 mm x 200 mm angiosculpt balloon. during the initial inflation of the angiosculpt balloon it was observed that the balloon appeared to be wrapped at the mid-junction, and then the balloon ruptured at approximately 10 atmospheres. upon flouro imaging, the distal (100 mm) balloon/scoring element was still inflated in the vessel. after multiple unsuccessful attempts to deflate the system by pulling negative on the inflation device, the physician attempted to cautiously remove the system by what he assumed was an intact balloon shaft. upon manipulation of the device, the balloon separated and the physician was left holding the remains of the proximal portion of the balloon/scoring element in his hand. after careful consideration, a decision was then made to attempt to slowly retrieve the filter wire positioned distally in hopes that the distal portion of the angiosculpt system could possibly be captured. this proved successful in only getting the system back over the aortic bifurcation to the rt. common femoral just proximal to the 6 fr interventional sheath. after flouro evaluation, it was observed that both the filter wire and the remaining angiosculpt system were now a bird nest of intertwined metal. the physician made a decision to size up to a 12 fr sheath in the rt. common femoral an effort to remove the devices through a larger conduit which proved unsuccessful. after a detailed brainstorming amongst the team members, a bronchoscopy forcep was inserted into the 12 fr sheath in an attempt to retrieve the remaining system. this proved only partially successful as only pieces of the angiosculpt were removed thinning the birds nest, but not enough to remove it through the sheath. approaching a 3 hours procedural time line, dr. (b)(6) made a patient care decision that he would have to completely remove the 12 fr sheath, and forcefully remove the entanglement of systems from the rt. common femoral artery knowing the risk of tearing that artery might occur. however, prior to doing so, he immediately gained arterial access in the lt. common femoral artery, and inserted a 6 fr x 45 cm pinnacle destination sheath contra laterally to the rt. external iliac. he manipulated a .035 x 260c m glidewire distally to the 12 fr sheath, and remaining angiosculpt/filter wire entanglement. next, a 7.0 mm x 40 mm mustang balloon was advanced from the lt. common femoral to the rt. external iliac just proximal to the 12 fr sheath and remaining angiosculpt/filter wire. in a coordinated effort by all team members, the 12 fr sheath and angiosculpt/filterwire birds nest were removed from the rt. common femoral while the 7.0 mm x 40 mm mustang balloon was simultaneously advanced and inflated in an attempt to achieve hemostasis of the rt. common femoral. after a prolonged inflation of more than 5 minutes the balloon was deflated and it appeared that hemostasis had been achieved. post balloon inflation angiography revealed no acute tears, and some bleeding at the rt. common femoral entry site. manual compression was maintained post procedure, and complete hemostasis was achieved with some site ecchymosis, but no post procedure hematoma. patient was admitted to the hospital over night for post observation care, and groin management.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:the angiosculpt device separated in the patient. additional intervention was required to remove from the patient, thus resulting in prolongation of the case. (b)(4). the angiosculpt device was returned in 3 pieces along with a filter wire and introducer sheath (both not manufactured by spnc). the first piece/section contained the distal tip, scoring element, distal and proximal marker bands, distal inner member, and a small section of the transition tube (intermediate bond). these pieces were intact to a section of the distal filter wire which was intact to an introducer sheath. the second piece/section contained a portion of the inner member that was intact to the other section of the filter wire. the third section contained a portion of the proximal balloon, majority of the transition tubing, inner member, strain relief, and luer. visual examination found a bent and damaged distal tip. the distal bond was damaged and the balloon was accordion and separated at the proximal end of the balloon. a longitudinal tear was observed at the proximal section of the balloon. the scoring element broke in multiple areas and separated completely from the distal bond. the inner member that was intact to the distal end of the filter wire was damaged and accordion. the other section of the inner member (proximal to the proximal marker band) was damaged and separated entirely from the device but was intact to the separated proximal section of the filter wire. the distal end of the transition tubing was accordion and separated but remained intact to the filter wire. the filter wire separated in 2 pieces approximately 89 cm from the proximal end of the filter with an overall total length of approximately 318 cm. per the ifu, retained device component is listed as a possible adverse effect of the procedure.</p><hr><h3 id="ALG-DIAG-193">Result ALG-DIAG-193</h3><p><a href="https://api.fda.gov/device/event.json?search=algorithm*+AND+(diagnostic*+OR+diagnosis*)&limit=500" target="blank">Original Source Query</a></p><p><b>Event Date</b>:20200827     <b>Report ID</b>:3005975625-2020-00028     <b>Report Source Code</b>:manufacturer report</p><p><b>Device Specialty Area</b>:unknown     <b>Device Class</b>:3</p><p><b>Device Reg Number</b>:unknown     <b>Device Name</b>:implant, dermal, for aesthetic use</p><p><b>Device Model Number</b>:n/a     <b>Device Catalogue Number</b>:n/a     <b>Device Lot Number</b>: tp30l-192921c</p><p></p><p><b>Product Problems</b>:patient-device incompatibility</p><p><b>Patient Problems</b>:unspecified vascular problem</p><p><b>Event Main Comments</b>:the event occurred outside of the u.s, in (b)(6). according to the received information, the patient developed important, painful, erythematous lesions on the upper lip the day after being injected with teosyal rha 2 in the bar code. the injector suspected herpes emergence during the injection. a medical expert was contacted to give a <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> on the reaction that occurred. according to him, if the patient has no history of herpes in the past, then the reaction was a vascular compromise. no further clarification was obtained from the injector.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:the medical expert recommended to apply the cream cicalfate and a sun protection only on the area. batch data analysis was undertaken. results show that this product is compliant with the applicable specifications. no element allows us to identify a defect in the quality, sterility or safety of our product. no non-conformity was identified throughout the production. literature data: de boulle k, heydenrych i. patient factors influencing dermal filler complications: prevention, assessment, and treatment. clin cosmet investig dermatol. 2015;8:205-14. signorini, m., et al.

determined by x-ray or ct scan, and clinical eval. one pt plasma sample tested initially as negative, but retesting of whole blood (remixed after being centrifuged and refrigerated) gave a positive result with clearview d-dimer.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:conclusion: all tests on retained and returned pouched devices from (b)(4) ran satisfactorily with no flow issues or deterioration in sensitivity. testing of the retain and returned tests did not indicate any gross deterioration in performance. overall assessment of the product sensitivity at the time of manufacture indicates that the sensitivity of batch (b)(4) was well above the cut off limit and meets our expectation for normally expected product performance. it should be noted that all d-dimer assays are not alike. depending on the commercial source, different antibodies used in a test have differing specificities for fibrinogen and fibrin and their derivatives. therefore the different commercially available d-dimer kits differ in reactivity toward d-dimer and have differing cut-off levels and specificity. as there is no standard for d-dimer, and the reactivity of different commercial kits to various standards is widely variable, it is difficult to correlate the results from one test type to another. additionally most acute dvt/pe pts have raised d-dimer levels but not necessarily 100%. there is a window of opportunity when d-dimer is raised and it relates directly to the degree of clot breakdown (fibrinolysis) at the time of testing. the time the pt sample was taken may therefore have some bearing on the negative results obtained. the performance characteristics detailed in the product ifu do not claim 100% sensitivity or specificity, therefore there is a known low level of possible false negative and false positive results. therefore in line with contemporary <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>s for suspected dvt/pe, high probability pts are not safe to exclude from further testing based on the results of d-dimer tests. we do not recommend that d-dimer tests be used as stand-alone tests for exclusion of dvt/pt. therefore for any correlation studies between test methods it is necessary that all samples tested must be confirmed as clinically positive or negative. with regard to the discrepant result whereby the test result were obtained from the same sample after two days stored at 2-8c, it should also be noted that the clearview simplify d-dimer ifu states that all samples are tested within 24 hours as its potentially possible that the d-dimer ag concentration may increase over time due to the clotting factors within the sample which may cause discrepant results over time. on a final note, it is worth checking for correct test procedure to ensure that the correct volume of blood was added, there is no evidence of sample clotting and two fully formed drops of buffer were added to the test. it is very important to wait the full 10 minutes until results are read.</p><hr><h3 id="ALG-DIAG-198">Result ALG-DIAG-198</h3><p><a

in conjunction with the full clinical context of the patient. the performance characteristics detailed in the product ifu do not claim 100% sensitivity or specificity; therefore there is a known low level of possible false negative and false positive results. it is noted in this case, from the complaint questionnaire, that the patient's dvt was located in the calf. a paper by keeling et al (british journal of haematology 2004; 124: 15-25) states that, in a review of the performance of several qualitative d-dimer tests, isolated calf dvts only have a 16-67% assay sensitivity, compared to all other types of dvts which result in 80-94% assay sensitivity. although clearview simplify d-dimer was not included in the study, it is reasonable to expect that the sensitivity of clearview simplify d-dimer is also reduced for isolated calf dvts, as this test is also qualitative. calf vein thrombi can result in minimal fibrinolysis which can cause possible false negatives. therefore in line with contemporary <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>s for suspected dvt/pe, high probability patients are not safe to exclude from further testing based on the results of d-dimer tests alone. bbi do not recommend that d-dimer tests be used as stand-alone tests for exclusion of dvt/pe. this is the reason that the product insert claims that the test is

the first capillary sample being taken (patient had been symptomatic for one week), the patient's d-dimer level may have been below the cut-off of the clearview simplify d-dimer test, resulting in a negative result. there needs to be active fibrinolysis for a positive result on the clearview simplify. d-dimer has a half-life of approximately 6 hours in the circulation of individuals with normal renal function. patients with stabilised clots and not undergoing active fibrin deposition and plasmin activation, may not give detectable d-dimer elevations. the size of the clot could also have an effect on whether the d-dimer can be detected - a smaller clot would produce lower levels of d-dimer which could be below the cut-off of the clearview simplify d-dimer test. in conclusion, in this case of false negative results with the clearview simplify d-dimer, the likely root cause is that the negative result was obtained in line with the expected low level of false negative results with this test..this follow-up report provides testing data from return devices from the same kit, from the user. the actual device used was discarded, however two pouched devices remaining in the kit box were returned to bbi solutions on 03 dec 2015. both devices were tested with two d-dimer positive samples from the standard qc release panel that contain the lowest levels of d-dimer. all tests on

with a left vad and a right vad flow and power dropped suddenly with suction and low flow alarm activated on the right vad. as per the vad coordinator, the hospital medical staff attempted to address the low flows and suction alarm by lowering the speed of the right vad; flow reduced to 0.2l/min and speed reduced from 2700rpm to 2200rpm with no change to flow. the controller was changed and indicated immediate increase in flow to the usual flow rate for the patient. it was reported that the log files were indicative of an occlusion of the right vad inflow at the time of the event. as per the vad coordinator: patient had an episode of decreased pump flows from around 4.0lpm to 0.7lpm, patient central venous pressure (cvp) noted to increase. patient in atrial fibrillation (af), febrile. anticoagulated with heparin infusion and within therapeutic range. plasma free hemoglobin (hb) within normal limits. lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) not attended. trans-oesophageal echocardiogram (toe)

via review of the controller log files which indicates a decrease in estimated flow. post-explant functional analysis confirmed that pump (b)(4) met pre-implant requirements. dhr review, visual examination and dimensional verification did not identify manufacturing or design discrepancies that may have caused or contributed to the reported event. post-explant evaluation of the pump demonstrated no evidence of thrombus within the pump and no indication of abnormal wear, abrasions or scratches on the impeller or any of the pump housing surfaces. however, the site found a suspected thrombus in the inflow cannula of the rvad and a dilated right ventricle. further inspection of the explanted pump by the site revealed a large clot in the inflow cannula. applicable risk documentation and experience with events of similar circumstances were considered; events with inadequate flow rates may be attributed to an occlusion due to thrombus formation/ingestion within the device. based on the investigation conducted, the most probable root cause of the reported event can be attributed to thrombus formation which could have resulted in the reported low flows. this is one of two reports (3007042319-2015-00365 and 366) submitted for devices related to the same event. heartware will submit a supplemental report when new facts arises which materially alters

supplemental report is being submitted for device evaluation and update to investigation completion. the product event summary was revised. revised product event summary: the pump ((b)(6)) and controller ((b)(6)) were not returned for evaluation. review of the sterility certificate confirmed that the associated device met all requirements for release. review of the log files associated with (b)(6) revealed two electrical fault alarms logged on 17-may-2019, one (1) electrical fault alarm logged on 21-may-2019, and four (4) electrical fault alarms logged on 01-feb-2020; all of the alarms were due to an overcurrent condition on the front stator, resulting in the pump running on the rear stator only. additionally, eight (8) reactivation events were logged between 16-may-2019 and 17-may-2020 and nine (9) reactivation events were logged on 01-feb-2020, indicative of an overcurrent condition on the front stator. analysis of the data log file revealed that the overcurrent condition had been present throughout the analyzed period, indicating that the pump had been running on the rear stator only. multiple high watt alarms were logged between 16-may-2019 and 16-mar-2020; the high watt alarms are indicative of the increased power consumption associated with the pump running on a single stator. a vad disconnect alarm was logged on 18-mar-2020 at 12:50:24 due to open phases on the rear stator while the front stator was disabled due to the overcurrent condition. of note, it was reported that the vad stopped when the patient bent over. at 12:51:26, a vad stop alarm was logged, indicating a failure of the pump to restart after multiple attempts. at the time of the vad stop alarm, the rear stator was not connected due to multiple open phases while the front stator was connected normally; however, the pump was unable to start successfully on the front stator only. a vad disconnect alarm was then logged at 12:53:36, which corresponds with the reported decommissioning of the pump. as a result, the reported electrical fault, high power, reactivation events, and vad stop events were confirmed. however, the reported driveline wire damage event could not be confirmed due to insufficient evidence. based on the risk documentation and the available information, a possible root cause of the electrical fault alarms, reactivation events, and high power events can be attributed, but not limited, to damage to the driveline wires and/or driveline connector. a possible root cause of the reported driveline wire damage event may be attributed, but not limited, to wear and/or the handling of the device. based on the available information, the most likely root cause of the initial vad disconnect alarm on 18-mar-2020 can be attributed to a marginal connection between the driveline cable and the controller when the patient bent over. the most likely root cause of the vad stop alarm can be attributed to failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. (b)(6)was not in scope of fca cvg-21-q3-21. capa pr00532915 is investigating pump failures to restart outside the subpopulation of fca cvg-21-q3-21. information from the site indicated that after having the vad decommissioned the patient was recurrently re-admitted for parapneumonic effusions, heart failure symptoms, shortness of breath and panic attacks related to their ongoing substance abuse. most recently, the patient was admitted to the critical care unit and received psychiatric consult. it was further reported that its not sure if the patient will ever be eligible for transplant due to the ongoing substance abuse and that the patient recovered without a heart transplant. based on the available information, the device may have caused or contributed to the reported event. per the instructions for use, pleural effusion, worsening heart failure, respiratory dysfunction, and infection are known potential complications associated with the implantation of a vad. there was no evidence that the patient had a history of similar adverse events. possible clinical factors that may have contributed to this event include the patient¿s pre-existing history and related comorbidities, the progression of their underlying disease, issues related to the therapeutic use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications and the patient's complex post-operative course. there are possible patient, pharmacological and procedural factors that may have contributed to this event. investigation of this event is completed and the file will be closed. if new information is

provided in the future, a supplemental report will be issued..a supplemental report is being submitted for device evaluation and investigation completion, additional information and correction. the additional information is the reporting of the associated device of (b)(6). correction, the event description stated that the driveline (dl) was inspected and a dl connector cleaning (dlcc) was schedule. that dlcc abbreviation was further stated inadvertently in the rest of the event description for follow-up regulatory report one and two as dllc, therefore dllc should be changed to dlcc. product event summary: a segment of the driveline from the ventricular assist device (vad) along with the connector and four controllers were returned for evaluation. review of the manufacturing records confirmed that the associated pump met all requirements prior to release. various analyses were conducted and reviewed in order to evaluate the performance of the devices in relation to the reported event. failure analysis of the returned controllers revealed that the devices passed functional testing. additionally, failure analysis of the controller (b)(6) revealed that the controller passed visual inspection. visual inspection from the controllers (b)(6) revealed contamination in the driveline connectors. failure analysis of the returned driveline segment revealed that the device passed functional testing, however visual inspection of the driveline revealed foreign material inside the driveline cable connector. supplemental testing revealed abnormal resistance values on one of the phases which may be attributed to the traces of foreign material in the driveline connector. log file analysis revealed 20 electrical fault alarms due to an open phase on the front stator logged on (b)(6) starting from 09-oct-2019 through 20-oct-2019. the controller was exchanged to (b)(6) after two rounds of driveline connector cleaning's performed on 21-oct-2019. log file analysis from controller (b)(6) revealed five electrical fault alarms due to open phases on both stators were logged from 25-oct-2019 through 27-oct-2019. a vad disconnect alarm was logged on 28-oct-2019 likely due to a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller which correlates with the reported driveline cleaning procedure. a controller exchange was then performed to (b)(6) and an electrical fault alarm was logged at 11:35:21 on 28-oct-2019 due to the front stator not being connected. this was shortly followed by a vad stopped alarm due to a failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. a controller exchange to (b)(6) was then performed to troubleshoot the alarm and a successful motor start event was logged at 11:36:43. further analysis of the alarm file revealed 49 electrical fault alarms logged from 30-oct-2019 through 05-nov-2019 due to an open phase in the rear stator, causing the pump to run on the front stator only. another round of driveline connector cleaning was performed on 05-nov-2019 and the controller was exchanged to mitigate the reported alarms. therefore, even though contamination was not observed when the controller (b)(6) was returned for analysis , it is likely that there was contamination present at the time the electrical faults were triggered on this controller. a driveline splice procedure was performed to mitigate the reported conditions. as a result, the reported event was confirmed. based on the available information, a possible root cause of the reported electrical fault alarms event can be attributed to contamination observed in the pump connectors of the controllers and driveline. an internal investigation was initiated to evaluate issues related to driveline connector contamination leading to electrical faults. based on the internal investigation, the most probable root cause has been attributed to design/training issues. the most likely root cause of the vad stopped alarm can be attributed to failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. capa: 00333 an internal investigation evaluated failures of the pump to restart at the system level (interaction between the pump and peripheral devices). based on an extensive internal investigation the likely contributing cause for failure to restart was the inability of the pump-start <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> to provide sufficient torque to overcome abnormally high mechanical resistance caused by unknown conditions that existed prior to the failed restart attempt. additional products: d4: serial#: (b)(6); h3:

associated with (b)(6) revealed a controller power up event on 03-oct-2019, at 15:18:09. the data point prior to the loss of power revealed that an active adapter was connected to power port one and (b)(6) was connected to power port two with 71% relative state of charge (rsoc). the data point recorded after the loss of power revealed that (b)(6) was connected to power port one and (b)(6) was connected to power port two . the controller was without power for 12 seconds. a vad stopped alarm was then logged at 15:18:56 indicating that the motor failed to restart on multiple attempts and was followed by several additional vad stopped alarms and controller power up events. several vad disconnect alarms were recorded on (b)(6) on 03-oct-2019. an analysis of the alarm file revealed that the vad disconnect alarms were most likely false alarms, given that the speed re corded at the onset of the alarm was higher than the set speed. this indicates that a possible loss of synchronization of commutation occurred. commutation is the process of switching winding current to generate motion. if the vad rotational speed drifts higher th an the speed set-point, the motor voltage will decrease to achieve the desired speed. however, if there is no change to the speed (speed reading remains frozen), the voltage will continue to decrease to zero. this likely caused the current to decrease to zero, triggering a vad disconnect alarm, even if the driveline was still physically connected to the controller. additionally, analysis of the alarm log file revealed that multiple power disconnect alarms were logged on (b)(6) involving (b)(6). during the power disconnect alarms, a safety alert word (saw) value was recorded indicating an overcurrent alert. the event log recorded a high power consumption during the motor starts, which required more current from the batteries. the battery was most likely physically disconnected by the patient shortly after, causing the controller to log this event as a power disconnect alarm. furthermore, several controller fault alarms were logged on 03-oct-2020 since 17:50:38 due to the increased current required from the batteries. review of the controller log files associated with (b)(6) revealed a controller power up event on 03-oct-2019 at 16:29:41, likely during a controller exchange. several vad disconnect alarms were recorded on (b)(6) on 03-oct-2019. an analysis of the alarm file revealed that these vad disconnect alarms were also likely false alarms, given that the speed recorded at the onset of the alarm was higher than the set speed, indicative of a possible loss of synchronization of commutation. a vad stopped alarm was then logged at 16:31:32 indicating that the motor failed to restart on multiple attempts, followed by more vad disconnect alarms and controller power up events, likely due to troubleshooting of the alarms. additionally, analysis of the alarm log file revealed multiple power disconnect alarms were logged on (b)(6) involving (b)(6). during the power disconnect alarms, a safety alert word (saw) value was recorded indicating an over current alert. the event log recorded a high power consumption

commutation, leading to false vad disconnect alarms. a possible root cause of the loss of power can be attributed to a disconnection of both power sources and/or to an intermittent disconnection on both power sources. a possible root cause of the reported power disconnect alarms may be attributed, but not limited, to a physical disconnection of the power source. the most likely root cause of the vad stopped alarms can be attributed to failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. an internal investigation is evaluating events involving pump failures to restart. additional products:

((b)(6)) were returned for evaluation. two (2) batt eries ((b)(6)) were not returned for evaluation. various analyses were conducted and reviewed in order to evaluate the performance of the devices in relation to the reported event. review of (b)(6) manufacturing documentation confirmed that the associated device met all requirements for release. failure analysis of the returned controllers revealed that the devices passed visual inspection and functional testing. failure analysis of the returned pump revealed that the device passed visual examination and functional testing. internal pathological report revealed no evidence of thrombus within the device. dimensional verification revealed that the front preload measurement was found to be deviating from the specification. capa pr00578223 was opened to investigate post-explant issues found during failure analysis of returned pumps. dimensional verification also revealed that the front housing disc curvature was found to be deviating from specifications. further analysis revealed that the impeller could potentially contact the front housing at its outer shroud, which leads to increased starting friction at the housing to impeller interface; this increase in friction was investigated under the capa pr00502194 investigation. review of the controller log files associated with controller, (b)(6), revealed a controller power up event on (b)(6) 2019, at 14 :05:10. the data point prior to the loss of power revealed that (b)(6) was connected to power port one (1) with 24% relative state of charge (rsoc) and (b)(6) was connected to power port two (2) with 96% rsoc. the data point recorded after the loss of power revealed that no power source was connected to power port one (1) and (b)(6) was connected to power port two (2). the controller was without power for 14 seconds. a vad stopped alarm was logged at 14:05:59 indicating that the pump failed to restart after multiple attempts. four (4) power disconnect alarms were logged from 14:07:20 through 14:10:12 involving (b)(6). during the power disconnect alarms, a safety alert word (saw) value was recorded indicating an overcurrent alert. the event log recorded a high-power consumption during the attempted motor start, which required more current from the batteries. the batteries were most likely physically disconnected by the patient shortly after, causing the controller to log this event as a power disconnect alarm. a vad disconnect alarm was logged at 14:10:52 due to the physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller. this was followed by multiple additional controller power up events and vad disconnect alarms, likely due to troubleshooting of the controller. review of the controller log files associated with controller, (b)(6), revealed a controller power up event on (b)(6) 2019, at 14:13:10. a vad disconnect alarm was logged following the controller power up at 14:13:36, indicating that the controller was powered up without the driveline cable connected, likely in preparation for a controller exchange. a vad stopped alarm was logged at 14:15:06 indicating that the pump failed to restart after multiple attempts. this was followed by multiple additional controller power up events and vad disconnect alarms, likely due to troubleshooting of the controller. as a result, the reported event was confirmed. a possible root cause of the loss of power can be attributed to a disconnection of both power sources and/or to an intermittent disconnection on one or both power sources. capa pr00551638 is investigating controller losses of power. a possible root cause of the reported power disconnect alarms may be attributed, but not limited, to a physical disconnection of the power source. the most likely root cause of the vad disconnect alarms observed in the log files may be attributed to a physical disconnection of the driveline from the co ntroller. the most likely root cause of the vad stopped alarms can be attributed to failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. (b)(6) is part of fca cvg-21-q3-21. capa pr00502194 investigated pump failures to restart. based on an investigation conduct ed under capa pr00502194, the most likely root cause of the failure to restart event may be attributed to outer shroud contact that created more friction at the housing to impeller interface. even though this capa is now closed, (b)(6) falls within the bounds of this capa. investigation of this event is completed and the file will be closed. if new information is received, the file will be re-opened and a supplemental will be submitted. medtronic is submitting

for evaluation. various analyses were conducted and reviewed in order to evaluate the performance of the devices in relation to the reported event. review of the manufacturing records confirmed that the associated vad (b)(4) met all requirements prior to release. based on the available information, it was determined that the vad (b)(4) was implanted on the left ventricle and vad (b)(4) was implanted on the right ventricle. failure analysis of the returned controllers revealed that the devices passed visual inspection and functional testing. failure analysis of the returned vad (b)(4) revealed that the device passed visual examination, functional testing, and dimensional verification. internal pathological report revealed evidence of thrombus within the vad (b)(4). failure analysis of the returned vad (b)(4) revealed that the device passed visual examination and dimensional verification. post-explant functional analysis revealed that the vad (b)(4) deviated from pre-implant requirements, with power average consumption of 2.07 watts vs 2.03 watts. since this deviation in power was not present prior to release of the device, it was most likely introduced during use and does not affect the functionality of the vad. internal pathological report revealed no evidence of thrombus within the vad (b)(4). review of controller (b)(4) log files associated with vad (b)(4) revealed 14 critical battery alarms due to the batteries depleting below 10% relative state of charge (rsoc) starting at 02:37:36 and 4 controller fault alarms logged on (b)(6) 2020 starting at 03:47:48. a controller fault alarm will occur if the battery is approaching 0% rsoc. log file analysis revealed that, at the time of the first critical battery alarm, a battery was connected to power port 1 with 20% rsoc and another battery was connected to power port 2 with 9% rsoc. both batteries were then allowed to deplete completely. no anomalies were observed with the power consumption and power management of the batteries; the batteries discharged and behaved as expected. a controller power up event was then logged on at 04:15:45. the data point recorded before the power up event revealed that the same batteries were connected to power ports 1 and 2; both batteries were allowed to deplete completely, resulting in a loss of power to the controller. the data point recorded after the power up revealed that no power source was connected to power port 1 and a different battery was connected to power port 2. the controller was without power for 17 minutes and 11 seconds. a vad stopped alarm was then recorded at 04:16:23 due to a failure of the vad to restart after several attempts. this was followed by multiple vad disconnect alarms indicating a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller, which likely corresponds with the reported controller exchange and troubleshooting, with several more vad stopped alarms. several additional controller power up events were logged on (b)(6) 2020 through 05:17:15, likely due to troubleshooting of the device. 65 suction alarms and 12 low flow alarms were logged starting from (b)(6) 2020. review of the controller (b)(4) log files associated with vad (b)(4) revealed a controller power up event on (b)(6) 2020 at 04:23:42. review of the data log files revealed that the controller was not in use leading up to the reported event. the controller (b)(4) was likely the patient¿s back-up controller and was used to troubleshooting the alarms associated with (b)(4). a vad stopped alarm was then recorded at 04:24:03 due to a failure of the vad to restart after several attempts. this was followed by a vad disconnect alarm indicating a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller. review of the controller (b)(4) log files associated with vad (b)(4) revealed a controller power up event on (b)(6) 2020 at 04:38:18. review of the data log files revealed that the controller was not in use prior to the reported event, and was likely the patients back-up controller assigned to vad (b)(4). based on the reported event details, backup controller (b)(4) was likely used to troubleshooting the alarms associated with vad (b)(4). a vad stopped alarm was then recorded at 04:38:39 due to a failure of the vad to restart after several attempts. this was followed by a vad disconnect alarm indicating a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller. review of additional controller log files associated with vad (b)(4) revealed a vad disconnect alarm was logged on (b)(6) 2020 at 05:26:31, indicating a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller. log file analysis also revealed intermittent suction events during the analyzed period and three (3) suction alarms recorded on (b)(6) 2020. additionally, 12 low flow alarms were recorded since (b)(6) 2020. as a result, the reported event was confirmed. information received from the site indicated that the patient presented with suspected thrombus, vomiting blood, and subsequently expired. per the instructions for use, thrombus and death are known potential complications associated with the implantation of a vad. there was no evidence that the patient had a hi story of similar adverse events. based on the risk documentation, possible causes of the observed low flow/suction events may be attributed to multiple factors including but not limited to thrombus at the inflow cannula/outflow graft, constriction at the outflow graft, poor vad filling, inappropriate vad pump rotational speed. the most likely root cause of the critical battery, controller fault alarms, and loss of power can be attributed to the patient allowing batteries to depleting below 10%. the most likely root cause of the vad disconnect alarms can be attributed to a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller. the most likely root cause of the vad stopped alarms can be attributed to failure of the vad to restart after several attempts. capa (b)(4) is investigating vad failures to restart. possible clinical factors that may have contributed to this event include the patient¿s pre-existing condition of cardiomyopathy, the progression of their underlying disease, issues related to the therapeutic use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications and the patient's complex post-operative course. there are possible patient, pharmacological and procedural factors that may have contributed to this event. additional products: brand name: heartware ventricular assist system ¿ controller 2.0, model #:

reviewed in order to evaluate the performance of the devices in relation to the reported event. a review of the manufacturing documentation confirmed that the associated pump and controller (b)(6) met all requirements for release. failure analysis of the returned pump revealed that the device passed visual examination, functional testing, and dimensional verification. further analysis revealed that the impeller could potentially contact the front housing at its outer shroud, which leads to increased starting friction at the housing to impeller interface; this increase in friction was investigated under the capa pr00502194 investigation. internal pathological report revealed no evidence of thrombus within the device. failure analysis of the returned controllers ((b)(6) revealed that the devices passed visual inspection and functional testing. failure analysis of the returned controller (b)(6) revealed that the pump connector was found loose from the controller housing. an internal inspection did not reveal evidence of fluid ingress. review of the controller log files associated with the patient¿s primary controller, (b)(6), revealed a vad disconnect alarm logged on

16:01:31. the controller was without power for 4 minutes and 49 seconds, indicating that the controller was likely powered up after the initial controller exchange due to an unsuccessful motor start attempt, as mentioned in the reported event details. a vad stopped alarm was logged on (b)(6) on 03/jan/2020 at 16:02:13, indicating that the pump failed to restart after several attempts, which was followed by several more vad stopped and vad disconnect alarms. log file analysis revealed power consumption above 25 watts during the period in which the pump was attempting to restart. additionally, a review of the (b)(6) log files revealed that the controller logged an entry in the event file at 16:03:52, indicating memory corruption between the user interface controller (uic) and the pump motor controller (pmc). the uic is the main integrated chip responsible for the operations of the controller, including recording data in the controller log files, while the pmc is responsible for capturing pump parameters, monitoring and maintaining the pump at the desired speed. the event file also logged an entry at 16:03:52, indicating that the pmc had reset itself intentionally. the pmc reset was followed nine (9) seconds later, at 16:04:01, by a controller fault alarm that was due to the pump not starting after the pmc reset. based on the analysis, the controller fault alarm and pmc reset were triggered by pump stop after the pump failed to restart after several attempts. the pmc firmware is designed to detect memory corruption errors. in this event, the pmc firmware was erroneously triggered due to the way the firmware updated the memory variables when the pump was stopped. the observed pmc reset did not contribute to the reported vad stop event. review of the controller log files associated with the controller (b)(6) revealed multiple vad stopped and vad disconnect alarms logged on 03/jan/2020. the vad stopped alarms were due to a failure of the pump to start after several attempts. the vad disconnect alarms are likely due to a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controllers, which correlates with the multiple controller exchanges reported to troubleshoot the alarms. as a result, the reported controller loose/damage, vad stopped alarms, failure to restart, controller fault alarm, and high power events were confirmed. the reported pump noisy and vibration events could not be confirmed due to insufficient evidence. the most likely root cause of the reported loose driveline connector port event can be attributed to improper assembly. capa pr00508470 was opened to investigate loose connectors with controller 2.0. a possible root cause of the reported controller fault alarm and observed pmc reset event can be attributed, but not limited, to pmc firmware recording erroneously memory values during pump failure to restart event. based on the investigation conducted, the most likely root cause of the vad disconnect alarms observed in the log files may be attributed to a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller, likely due to troubleshooting of the vad stopped alarms. the most likely root cause of the vad stopped alarms and high power event can be attributed to failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. hw40796 is part of fca cvg-21-q3-21. capa pr00502194 investigated pump failures to restart. this condition of the pump¿s failure to restart might have resulted in the reported ¿vad chugging while attempting to restart and vibration¿. based on an investigation conducted under capa pr00502194, the most likely root cause of the failure to restart event may be attributed to outer shroud contact that created more friction at the housing to impeller interface. even though this capa is now closed, hw40796 falls within the bounds of this capa. investigation of this event is completed and the file will be closed. if new information is received, the file will be re-opened and a

returned for evaluation. various analyses were conducted and reviewed in order to evaluate the performance of the devices in relation to the reported event. a review of the manufacturing documentation confirmed that the associated pump and controller (b)(6) met all requirements for release. failure analysis of the returned pump revealed that the device passed visual examination and functional testing. further analysis revealed that the impeller could potentially contact the front housing at its outer shroud, which leads to increased starting friction at the housing to impeller interface; this increase in friction was investigated under the capa pr00502194 investigation. internal pathological report revealed no evidence of thrombus within the device. failure analysis of the returned controllers (b)(6) revealed that the devices passed visual inspection and functional testing. failure analysis of the returned controller (b)(6) revealed that the pump connector was found loose from the controller housing. an internal inspection did not reveal evidence of fluid ingress. review of the controller log files associated with the patient¿s primary controller, (b)(6), revealed a vad

were conducted and reviewed in order to evaluate the performance of the devices in relation to the reported event. review of the manufacturing records confirmed that the associated vad ((b)(4)) met all requirements prior to release. based on the available information, it was determined that that vad ((b)(4)) was implanted on the left ventricle and vad ((b)(4)) was implanted on the right ventricle. failure analysis of the returned controllers revealed that the devices passed visual inspection and functional testing. failure analysis of the returned vad ((b)(4)) revealed that the device passed visual examination, functional testing, and dimensional verification. internal pathological report revealed evidence of thrombus within the vad (b)(4). failure analysis of the returned vad ((b)(4)) revealed that the device passed visual examination and dimensional verification. post-explant functional analysis revealed that the vad (b)(4) deviated from pre-implant requirements, with power average consumption of 2.07 watts vs 2.03 watts. since this deviation in power was not present prior to release of the device, it was most likely introduced during use and does not affect the functionality of the vad. internal pathological report revealed no evidence of thrombus within the vad (b)(4). review of controller ((b)(4)) log files associated with vad ((b)(4)) revealed 14 critical battery alarms due to the batteries depleting below 10% relative state of charge (rsoc) starting at 02:37:36 and four controller fault alarms logged on (b)(6) 2020 starting at 03:47:48. a controller fault alarm will occur if the battery is approaching 0% rsoc. log file analysis revealed that, at the time of the first critical battery alarm, a battery was connected to power port one with 20% rsoc and another battery was connected to power port two with 9% rsoc. both batteries were then allowed to deplete completely. no anomalies were observed with the power consumption and power management of the batteries; the batteries discharged and behaved as expected. a controller power up event was then logged on at 04:15:45. the data point recorded before the power up event revealed that the same battery was connected to power port one and the same battery was connected to power port two; both batteries were allowed to deplete completely, resulting in a loss of power to the controller. the data point recorded after the power up revealed that no power source was connected to power port one and a new battery was connected to power port two. the controller was without power for 17 minutes and 11 seconds. a vad stopped alarm was then recorded at 04:16:23 due to a failure of the vad to restart after several attempts. this was followed by multiple vad disconnect alarms indicating a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller, which likely corresponds with the reported controller exchange and troubleshooting, with several more vad stopped alarms. several additional controller power up events were logged on (b)(6) 2020 through 05:17:15, likely due to troubleshooting of the device. 65 suction alarms and 12 low flow alarms were logged starting from (b)(6) 2020 through (b)(6) 2020. review of the controller ((b)(4)) log files associated with vad ((b)(4)) revealed a controller power up event on (b)(6) 2020 at 04:38:18. review of the data log files revealed that the controller was not in use prior to the reported event, and was likely the patients back-up controller assigned to vad (b)(4). based on the reported event details, backup controller ((b)(4)) was likely used to troubleshooting the alarms associated with vad ((b)(4)). a vad stopped alarm was then recorded at 04:38:39 due to a failure of the vad to restart after several attempts. this was followed by a vad disconnect alarm indicating a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller. review of the controller ((b)(4)) log files associated with vad (b)(4), revealed a vad disconnect alarm was logged on (b)(6) 2020 at 05:26:31 indicating a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller. log file analysis also revealed intermittent suction events during the analyzed period and three suction alarms recorded on (b)(6) 2020. additionally, 12 low flow alarms were recorded since (b)(6) 2020. as a result, the reported event was confirmed. based on the risk documentation, possible causes of the observed low flow/suction events may be attributed to multiple factors including but not limited to thrombus at the inflow cannula/outflow graft, constriction at the outflow graft, poor vad filling, inappropriate vad rotational speed. the most likely root cause of the critical battery, controller fault alarms, and loss of power can be attributed to the patient allowing batteries to depleting below 10%. the most likely root cause of the vad disconnect alarms can be attributed to a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller. the most likely root cause of the vad stopped alarm can be attributed to failure of the vad to restart after several attempts. based on historical review, the likely contributing cause for failure to restart was the inability of the vad-start <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> to provide sufficient torque to overcome abnormally high mechanical resistance caused by unknown conditions that existed prior to the failed restart attempt. possible clinical factors that may have contributed to this event include the patients pre-existing condition of cardiomyopathy, the progression of their underlying disease, issues related to the therapeutic use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications and the patient's complex post-operative course. there are possible patient, pharmacological and procedural factors that may have contributed to this event. investigation of this event is completed and the file will be closed. if new information is received, the file will be re-opened and a supplemental will be submitted. if information is provided in the future, a supplemental report will be issued..a supplemental report is being submitted for investigation completion. updates to the product event summary are indicated below: product event summary: the instructions for use (ifu) with unknown lot number was not returned for evaluation. further analysis revealed outer shroud contact that created more friction at the housing to impeller interface. power deviations are being investigated under capa pr00532915. after the vad stopped alarms, a safety alert word (saw) value was recorded on the batteries, indicating an overcurrent alert. it is likely the overcurrent condition prevented the batteries from providing power, resulting in the additional losses of power to the controller. there is insufficient information regarding the reported " instructions for use (ifu) was defective" event. as a result, the reported defective ifu event could not be confirmed. capa pr00551638 is investigating controller losses of power. capa pr00544941 is investigating controller loss of power during pump start due to battery discharge overcurrent condition.

supplemental report is being submitted for updated device analysis and investigation completion. product event summary: two (2) ventricular assist devices (vads) ((b)(4)) and three (3) controllers ((b)(4)) were returned for evaluation. various analyses were conducted and reviewed in order to evaluate the performance of the devices in relation to the reported event. review of the manufacturing records confirmed that the associated vad (b)(4) met all requirements prior to release. based on the available information, it was determined that the vad (b)(4) was implanted on the left ventricle and vad (b)(4) was implanted on the right ventricle. failure analysis of the returned controllers revealed that the devices passed visual inspection and functional testing. failure analysis of the returned vad (b)(4) revealed that the device passed visual examination, functional testing, and dimensional verification. internal pathological report revealed evidence of thrombus within the vad (b)(4). failure analysis of the returned vad (b)(4) revealed that the device passed visual examination and dimensional verification. post-explant functional analysis revealed that the vad (b)(4) deviated from pre-implant requirements, with power average consumption of 2.07 watts vs 2.03 watts. since this deviation in power was not present prior to release of the device, it was most likely introduced during use and does not affect the functionality of the vad. internal pathological report revealed no evidence of thrombus within the vad (b)(4). review of controller (b)(4) log files associated with vad (b)(4) revealed 14 critical battery alarms due to the batteries depleting below 10% relative state of charge (rsoc) starting at 02:37:36 and 4 controller fault alarms logged on (b)(6) 2020 starting at 03:47:48. a controller fault alarm will occur if the battery is approaching 0% rsoc. log file analysis revealed that, at the time of the first critical battery alarm, a battery was connected to power port 1 with 20% rsoc and another battery was connected to power port 2 with 9% rsoc. both batteries were then allowed to deplete completely. no anomalies were observed with the power consumption and power management of the batteries; the batteries discharged and behaved as expected. a controller power up event was then logged on at 04:15:45. the data point recorded before the power up event revealed that the same batteries were connected to power ports 1 and 2; both batteries were allowed to deplete completely, resulting in a loss of power to the controller. the data point recorded after the power up revealed that no power source was connected to power port 1 and a different battery was connected to power port 2. the controller was without power for 17 minutes and 11 seconds. a vad stopped alarm was then recorded at 04:16:23 due to a failure of the vad to restart after several attempts. this was followed by multiple vad disconnect alarms indicating a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller, which likely corresponds with the reported controller exchange and troubleshooting, with several more vad stopped alarms. several additional controller power up events were logged on (b)(6) 2020 through 05:17:15, likely due to troubleshooting of the device. 65 suction alarms and 12 low flow alarms were logged starting from (b)(6) 2020. review of the controller (b)(4) log files associated with vad (b)(4) revealed a controller power up event on (b)(6) 2020 at 04:23:42. review of the data log files revealed that the controller was not in use leading up to the reported event. the controller (b)(4) was likely the patient¿s back-up controller and was used to troubleshoot the alarms associated with (b)(4). a vad stopped alarm was then recorded at 04:24:03 due to a failure of the vad to restart after several attempts. this was followed by a vad disconnect alarm indicating a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller. review of the controller (b)(4) log files associated with vad (b)(4) revealed a controller power up event on (b)(6) 2020 at 04:38:18. review of the data log files revealed that the controller was not in use prior to the reported event, and was likely the patients back-up controller assigned to vad (b)(4). based on the reported event details, backup controller (b)(4) was likely used to troubleshooting the alarms associated with vad (b)(4). a vad stopped alarm was then recorded at 04:38:39 due to a failure of the vad to restart after several attempts. this was followed by a vad disconnect alarm indicating a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller. review of additional controller log files associated with vad (b)(4) revealed a vad disconnect alarm was logged on (b)(6) 2020 at 05:26:31, indicating a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller. log file analysis also revealed intermittent suction events during the analyzed period and three (3) suction alarms recorded on (b)(6) 2020. additionally, 12 low flow alarms were recorded since (b)(6) 2020. as a result, the reported event was confirmed. information received from the site indicated that the patient presented with suspected thrombus, vomiting blood, and subsequently expired. per the instructions for use, thrombus and death are known potential complications associated with the implantation of a vad. there was no evidence that the patient had a hi story of similar adverse events. based on the risk documentation, possible causes of the observed low flow/suction events may be attributed to multiple factors including but not limited to thrombus at the inflow cannula/outflow graft, constriction at the outflow graft, poor vad filling, inappropriate vad pump rotational speed. the most likely root cause of the critical battery, controller fault alarms, and loss of power can be attributed to the patient allowing batteries to depleting below 10%. the most likely root cause of the vad disconnect alarms can be attributed to a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller. the most likely root cause of the vad stopped alarms can be attributed to failure of the vad to restart after several attempts. capa (b)(4) is investigating vad failures to restart. possible clinical factors that may have contributed to this event include the patient¿s pre-existing condition of cardiomyopathy, the progression of their underlying disease, issues related to the therapeutic use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications and the patient's

supplemental report is being submitted for analysis and investigation completion. product event summary: the pump ((b)(6)) and two (2) controllers ((b)(6)) were returned for evaluation. various analyses were conducted and reviewed in order to evaluate the performance of the devices in relation to the reported event. a review of (b)(6)manufacturing documentation confirmed that the associated device met all requirements for release. failure analysis of the returned pump revealed that the device passed visual examination and functional testing. dimensional verification revealed that the front preload measurements was found to be deviating from specifications. capa pr00578223 was opened to investigate post-explant issues found during failure analysis of returned pumps. dimensional verification also revealed that the rear housing disc curvature and front housing disc curvature were found to be deviating from specifications. internal pathological report revealed no evidence of thrombus within the device. failure analysis of the returned controller ((b)(6)) revealed that the device passed visual inspection and functional testing. failure analysis of the returned controller ((b)(6)) revealed that the device passed functional testing. visual inspection revealed a bent pin within the controller serial port. the bent pin did not affect the functionality of the device, a data cable was able to properly connect to the controller. additionally, external visual inspection revealed contamination within both power ports of the controller. this is an additional observation not related to the reported event, likely due to the handling of the device. log file analysis revealed that (b)(6) was the patient¿s primary controller, initially in use at the time of the reported event. log file analysis associated with controller (b)(6) revealed two (2) vad disconnect alarms logged on 01/feb/2020 at 20:42:12 and 21:39:01, indicating a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller which corresponds with the reported event details. a successful motor start event was logged at 21:45:35, and thirty-six (36) low flow alarms were logged starting at 21:45:40. two (2) additional vad disconnect alarms were recorded on 02/feb/2020 at 00:20:66 and 00:28:51. review of controller log files associated with controller (b)(6) revealed a controller power-up event on 01/feb/2020 at 21:40:50. review of the log files revealed that the controller was last used on 19/jul/2018, indicating that the controller was likely the patient's backup controller. an electrical fault alarm was logged at 21:40:50 due to multiple phases open on the rear stator. a vad stopped alarm was logged at 21:41:17 due to a failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. a successful motor start was logged at 21:44:51. several additional vad disconnect and electrical fault alarms were logged due to open phases on both stators. furthermore, five (5) low flow alarms were logged since 01/feb/2020. of note, several controller power-up events and exchanges between the controllers were observed within the analyzed period, likely due to troubleshooting. as a result, the reported event was confirmed. based on the available information, the device may have caused or contributed to the reported low flow event. based on the risk documentation, possible causes of the reported low flow event may be attributed to multiple factors including but not limited to thrombus at the inflow cannula/outflow graft, constriction at the outflow graft, poor vad filling, inappropriate pump rotational speed. based on an investigation conducted under capa pr00384004, the root cause of bent/damaged socket pins within serial port connectors is attributed to misalignment during connection attempts between the metal receptacles on the controller and the plastic connector plugs in the data cables. the misalignment results in wear on the connector plugs that can lead to contact between the connector plug and socket pins from the controller. the socket pins may not withstand applied forces from subsequent misaligned connections, causing the pins to bend. the most likely root cause of the vad stopped alarm can be attributed to a failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. (b)(6) was not in scope of fca cvg-21-q3-21, which was initiated for pumps with failures to restart. capa pr00532915 is investigating pump failures to restart outside the subpopulation of fca cvg-21-q3-21. based on the available information the most likely root cause of the observed electrical fault alarms may be attributed, but not limited, to a marginal connection between the driveline and controller. a possible root cause of the observed controller power up events to the controllers can be attributed to troubleshooting and exchanges between the controllers. the most likely root cause of the vad disconnect alarms can be attributed to a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller. investigation of this event is completed and the file will be closed. if new information is received, the file will be re-opened and a supplemental will be submitted. medtronic is submitting this report to comply with fda reporting regulations under 21 cfr parts 4 and 803.

the reported electrical fault alarms may be attributed, but not limited, to a marginal connection between the driveline and controller. based on historical review of similar events, the likely contributing cause for failure to restart was the inability of the pump-start <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> to provide sufficient torque to overcome abnormally high mechanical resistance caused by unknown conditions that existed prior to the failed restart attempt. the most likely root cause of the reported damaged pin event can be attributed to a misalignment between the serial port and

product event summary: one vad pump and two controllers were not returned for evaluation. log file analysis revealed that (b)(6) was originally in use at the time of the reported event. review of the log files associated with (b)(6) revealed a decrease in power consumption and estimated flows starting on (b)(6) 2020 and 105 low flow alarms logged since (b)(6) 2020. a manual vad stop event was recorded on (b)(6) 2020 at 13:29:14, which corresponds with the reported turning off of the pump during thrombus treatment. a vad stopped alarm was then logged at 13:30:32, indicating that the pump failed to restart after multiple attempts. eleven (11) additional vad stopped alarms were logged due to failures of the pump to restart between 13:31:28 and 13:40:09. a vad disconnect alarm was then logged at 13:40:39, indicating a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller, likely during the reported controller exchange. review of the log files associated with (b)(6) revealed six (6) vad stopped alarms logged due to failures of the pump to restart recorded between 14:04:06 and 14:08:52. the power consumption logged at the time of each of the vad stopped alarms recorded on both controllers was greater than 27 watts. as a result, the reported event was confirmed. based on the available information, the most likely root cause of the reported ¿pump stopped and started working with high power¿ event can be attributed to failures of the pump to restart. the multiple attempts made by the pump to restart prior to each vad stopped alarm were likely perceived as the pump stopping and starting. an internal investigation was conducted to investigate failures of the pump to restart at the system level (interaction between the pump and peripheral devices). based on an extensive investigation conducted, the likely contributing cause for failure to restart was the inability of the pump-start <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> to provide sufficient torque to overcome abnormally high mechanical resistance caused by unknown conditions that existed prior to the failed restart attempt. based on the risk documentation, possible causes of the reported low flow event may be attributed to multiple factors including but not limited to thrombus at the inflow cannula/o utflow graft, constriction at the outflow graft, and/or poor vad filling. possible clinical factors that may have contributed to this event include the patient¿s pre-existing history and related comorbidities, the progression of their underlying disease, issues re lated to the therapeutic use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications and the patient¿s complex post-operative course. there are possible patient, pharmacological and procedural factors that may have contributed to this event.

and associated driveline cable were not returned for evaluation. review of the manufacturing documentation confirmed that the associated device met all requirements for release. on-site inspection of the driveline cable as well as visual evidence provided by the site revealed a break in the outer sheath. additionally, visual evidence revealed discoloration on the driveline outer sheath. a driveline sheath repair was performed to mitigate the conditions reported. of note, it was reported during the driveline sheath repair that a partial connection of the driveline connector was observed; after the driveline connector was properly connected, no electrical fault alarms were observed. review of controller log files revealed multiple electrical fault, high watt, vad disconnect, and vad stopped alarms were logged on (b)(6) 2020. two (2) electrical fault alarm were logged at 11:35:10 and 11:36:00 due to a phase open on the front stator, resulting in the pump running on a single stator. these likely triggered the subsequent high watt alarms, due to the increased power consumption required to run on a single stator. a vad disconnect alarm was logged at 11:36:28, indicating a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller, likely due to troubleshooting of the controller. the driveline was subsequently connect to the controller and this was followed by a vad stopped alarm was logged at 11:37:33 due to a critical phase open fault which indicated that a phase was open on both stators and a fault in front stator due to the front stator not being connected. at 11:37:42, an electrical fault alarm was logged due to the front not being connected. at 11:39:10, a vad stopped alarm was logged, indicating that the pump failed to restart after several attempts. this was followed by several more electrical fault alarms due to one phase open in the front stator and the front stator not being connected. multiple additional vad stopped alarms were logged on (b)(6) 2020, indicating that the pump failed to restart after multiple attempts and an open phase on both stators. in addition, multiple additional vad disconnect alarms were logged on (b)(6) 2020 likely due to troubleshooting of the controller. as a result, the reported events were confirmed. based on historical review of similar events, the most likely root cause of driveline sheath damage may be attributed to multiple factors including design issues and/or exposure to uv light. based on the available information, a possible root cause of the reported electrical fault alarms, initial vad stop alarm, and some additional vad stop alarms observe in the log files can be attributed, but not limited, to contamination by foreign material of the driveline connector or a marginal driveline connection. the most likely root cause of the observed vad disconnect alarms can be attributed to a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller, likely due to troubleshooting of the controller. the most likely root cause of the second vad stopped alarm and some additional vad stopped alarms observed in the log files can be attributed to failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. an internal investigation evaluated failures of the pump to restart at the system level (interaction between the pump and peripheral devices). based on an extensive investigation conducted, the likely contributing cause for failure to restart was the inability of the pump-start <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> to provide sufficient torque to overcome

controllers (b)(6) and seven batteries (b)(6) were not returned for evaluation. log file analysis revealed that (b)(6) was the patient's primary controller, initially in use at the time of the event. controller log files pertaining to (b)(6) revealed multiple vad disconnect and vad stopped alarms were logged on (b)(6) 2020. controller log files pertaining to (b)(6) revealed that this event was initiated by a controller power up event on (b)(6) 2020 at 16:29:44. the data point prior to the loss of power revealed that (b)(6) was connected to power port one (1) with 73% relative state of charge (rsoc) and (b)(6) was connected to power port two (2) with 44% rsoc. the data point recorded after the loss of power revealed that (b)(6) was connected to power port one (1) and (b)(6) was connected to power port two (2). no anomalies were recorded leading up to the loss of power. the controller was without power for 14 seconds. a vad stop alarm was then logged at 16:30:53 , indicating that the pump failed to restart after multiple attempts. this was followed by additional controller power up events, additional vad stopped alarms, and vad disconnect alarms, logged between 16:31:44 and 22:10:55, likely due to troubleshooting of the controller and/or controller exchanges. controller log files pertaining to (b)(6) revealed that a vad disconnect alarm was logged at 16:41:37 followed by a successful motor start event at 16:41:58 were logged on (b)(6) 2020. review of the event log file revealed that, prior to the motor start event, the controller last had power on (b)(6) 2020. review of the data log file revealed that the controller (b)(6) was not in use prior to the motor start event; the first data point logged since (b)(6)2020 was logged at 16:42:05 on (b)(6) 2020, indicating that the vad disconnect alarm and motor start event occurred due to a controller exchange from (b)(6). analysis of the alarm file pertaining to (b)(6) revealed multiple additional vad disconnect alarms, vad stopped alarms, and electrical fault alarms were logged on (b)(6) 2020. an additional vad disconnect alarm was logged on 16:42:34, indicating a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller. this was followed by controller power up event on (b)(6) 2020 at 16:57:57, likely due to troubleshooting of the controller and/or a controller exchange. a vad stop alarm was then logged at 16:59:06, indicating that the pump failed to restart after multiple attempts. this was followed by additional controller power up events, vad stopped alarms, and vad disconnect alarms, logged between 17:00:26 and 22:18:38, likely due to troubleshooting of the controller and/or controller exchanges. during troubleshooting of the controller, two (2) electrical fault alarms were logged at 18:27:04 and 18:27:34, indicating the rear stator was not connected. of note, review of the log files revealed high power consumption recorded during the failure to restart attempts. furthermore, several power disconnect alarms were logged on (b)(6) 2020 involving (b)(6) on controllers (b)(6). during the power disconnect alarms, a safety alert word (saw) value was recorded indicating an overcurrent alert. the event logs recorded a high-power consumption during attempted motor starts, which required more current from the batteries. the batteries were most likely physically disconnected by the patient shortly after, causing the controller to log these events as power disconnect alarms. as a result, the reported controller losses of power, vad stopped alarms, electrical fault alarms, driveline disconnects, power disconnects, failure to restart, and high power events were confirmed. information received from the site indicated that the vad was turned off and the outflow graft was ligated at the aorta. the vad was exchanged. additional information was received stating a suspected thrombus, however, as the pump was not returned for evaluation, the reported thrombus event could not be confirmed. per the instructions for use, device thrombus is a known potential complication associated with the implantation of a vad. there is no evidence that the patient had a history of thrombus events. the most likely root cause of the initial controller loss of power can be attributed to the reported disconnection of both power sources from the controller as described in the event details. the most likely root cause of the vad disconnect alarms can be attributed to a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller. based on the available information and risk documentation, a possible root cause of the electrical fault alarms can be attributed, but not limited, to a marginal driveline connection or contamination by foreign material of the driveline connector. based on log file analysis, the most likely root cause of the high power event can be attributed to high-power consumption during the attempted motor starts. the most likely root cause of the vad stopped alarms can be attributed to failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. the vad is part of an internal investigation that is investigating pump failures to restart. possible clinical factors that may have contributed to this event include the patient¿s pre-existing history and related comorbidities, the progression of their underlying disease, issues related to the therapeutic use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications and the patient's complex post-operative course. there are possible patient, pharmacological and procedural factors that may have contributed to this event. investigation of this event is completed and the file will be closed. if new information is received, the file will be re-opened and a supplemental will be submitted. medtronic is submitting this report to comply with fda reporting regulations under 21 cfr parts 4 and 803. this report is based upon information obtained by medtronic, which the company may

indicating that the pump failed to restart after multiple attempts. this was followed by multiple controller power up events and vad disconnect alarms likely due to troubleshooting of the controller con406946. analysis of the alarm file pertaining to con406946 also revealed multiple additional vad stopped alarms were logged on 08-mar-2020, indicating that the pump failed to restart after multiple attempts. additionally, analysis of the alarm file pertaining to con406946 revealed two electrical fault alarms were logged at 18:27:04 and 18:27:34 due to an open phase on the rear stator, resulting in the pump running on a single stator with increased power consumption. furthermore, analysis of the alarm log files pertaining to con406946 and con405351 revealed several power disconnect alarms were logged on 08-mar-2020 involving bat653622, bat807052, bat651993, bat653059 ,bat653585, bat653035, and bat653602. during the power disconnect alarms, a safety alert word (saw) value was recorded indicating an overcurrent alert. the event logs recorded a high-power consumption during attempted motor starts, which required more current from the batteries. the batteries were most likely physically disconnected by the patient shortly after, causing the controller to log these events as power disconnect alarms. in addition, review of the controller log files pertaining con406946 and con405351 revealed the pump was not running on the controllers on the last data point of each controller. of note, it was reported by the site that the vad was turned off and the outflow graft was ligated at the aorta, which corresponds with the pump not running on the controllers. as a result, the reported events were confirmed. based on the available information, a possible root cause of the losses of power can be attributed to a disconnection of both power sources as described in the event details. the most likely root cause of the vad disconnect alarms observed in the log files may be attributed to a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controllers. a possible root cause of the reported power disconnect alarms may be attributed, but not limited, to a physical disconnection of the power sources. based on the available information and risk documentation, a possible root cause of the reported electrical fault alarms can be attributed, but not limited, to physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller, contamination by foreign material of the driveline connector, and/or a marginal driveline connection.  based on log file analysis, the most likely root cause of the high power event can be attributed to the over current condition on the rear stator resulting in a pump running on a single stator with increased power consumption and/or high-power consumption during the attempted motor starts. the most likely root cause of the reported vad stopped alarms can be attributed to failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. an internal investigation evaluated failures of the pump to restart at the system level (interaction between the pump and peripheral devices). based on an extensive investigation conducted, the likely contributing cause for failure to restart was the inability of the pump-start <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> to provide sufficient torque to overcome abnormally high mechanical resistance caused by unknown conditions that existed prior to the failed restart attempt. additional products: d4: serial or lot#:  (b)(6) h3: yes h6: fda method code(s): 4112, 4114 h6: fda results code(s): 213 h6: fda

is being submitted for completed analysis and investigation. product event summary: the vad and controller were not returned for evaluation. controller log files pertaining to the controller revealed this event was initiated by a controller power up event which was logged on (b)(6) 2020 at 17:15:03. the data point prior to the loss of power revealed that a battery was connected to power port one with 87% relative state of charge (rsoc) and an active adapter was connected to power port two (2). the data point recorded after the loss of power revealed that the battery was connected to power port one and another battery was connected to power port two. the controller was without power for 14 seconds. no anomalies were recorded leading up to the loss of power. this was followed by a vad stopped alarm which was logged on (b)(6) 2020 at 17:15:46 due to a failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. controller log files pertaining to the controller also revealed multiple vad disconnect alarms and controller power up events without motor starts were logged on (b)(6) 2020 since 17:17:46, likely due to troubleshooting and/or the reported controller exchange. as a result, the reported loss of power and vad stopped event pertaining to the controller were confirmed. additionally, controller log files pertaining to the controller revealed pump's power consumption was within normal operating range for the past 14 days through (b)(6) 2020 and no high watt or low flow alarms were logged within the analyzed period. of note, it was reported that two controller exchanges were performed and controller log files from these controllers were not available for analysis. as a result, the reported failure to restart and "speed would not go above 800 revolutions per minute" events, after the controller exchange, could not be confirmed; however, it is likely the failure to restart event observed in the controller log files pertaining to the controller contributed to the reported events. the reported thrombus and "grinding noise" events could not be confirmed due to insufficient evidence. there is no evidence to indicate that a device malfunction or performance issue caused or contributed to the reported failure to restart event. a possible root cause of the loss of power can be attributed to a disconnection of both power sources and/or to an intermittent disconnection on one or both power sources. the most likely root cause of the vad stopped alarm can be attributed to failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. based on historical review of similar events, the likely contributing cause of the failure of the pump to restart after several attempts was the inability of the pump-start <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> to provide sufficient torque to overcome abnormally high mechanical resistance caused by unknown conditions that existed prior to the failed restart attempt. this condition of the pump¿s failure to restart might have resulted in the reported ¿grinding noise¿. possible clinical factors that may have contributed to this event include the patient¿s pre-existing history and related comorbidities, the progression of their underlying disease, issues related to the therapeutic use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications and the patient's complex post-operative course. there are possible patient, pharmacological and procedural factors that may have contributed to this event. additional products: con316924, d10: no. h3: yes. h6: fda method code(s): 4112, 4114. h6: fda results code(s): 213. h6:

returned for evaluation. no performance allegations were made against (b)(6). failure analysis of the returned driveline segment and the controller revealed that the devices passed functional testing and visual inspection. visual inspection of the driveline segment did not reveal any anomalies or wire damage within the cable. functional testing of the driveline revealed that the driveline passed the continuity test and locking mechanism test. as a result, the reported broken/disconnected wire event could not confirmed. review of the controller log files associated with the controller in use revealed several electrical fault alarms due to an open phase in the rear stator logged since 16:24:54 on (b)(6) 2020. several high watt alarms were logged since 20:24:22, due to the increased power consumption required to run on a single stator. several vad disconnect alarms and additional electrical fault alarms were logged due to open phases on both stators. log file analysis also revealed several vad stopped alarms were logged starting at 20:45:13 due to vad minimum speed failure, which is the result of the pump operating below 1400 rpms for 10 seconds. this fault was likely due to an open phase detected during an attempt to reactivate a stator. a vad stopped alarm was logged at 20:47:16 due to a failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. several additional vad disconnect, vad stopped, electrical fault, and high watt alarms were logged during the analyzed period. as a result, the reported electrical fault, vad stopped, vad disconnect alarms, and high power events were confirmed. possible root causes of the reported electrical fault and subsequent high power alarms may be attributed, but not limited, to a marginal connection between the driveline and controller. the most likely root cause of the vad disconnect alarms event can be attributed, but not limited, to a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller and/or due to open phases in both stators. the most likely root cause of the vad stopped alarm can be attributed to failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. based on historical review of similar events, the

17409364-1276), three (3) controllers ( (b)(6), five (5) batteries (b)(6), and two (2) controller ac adapters (b)(6) were returned for evaluation. various analyses were conducted and reviewed in order to evaluate the performance of the devices in relation to the reported event. failure analysis of the returned controllers (b)(6), batteries (b)(6), and controller ac adapters (b)(6) revealed that the devices passed visual inspection and functional testing. failure analysis of the returned outflow graft revealed that the device passed visual examination. failure analysis of the returned pump revealed that the device passed visual examination and functional testing. internal pathological report revealed no evidence of thrombus within the device. dimensional verification revealed that the rear housing disc curvature and front housing disc curvature were found to be deviating from release specifications. capa: pr00578223 was opened to investigate post-explant issues found during failure analysis of returned pumps. further analysis revealed outer shroud contact that created more friction at the housing to impeller interface, this increase in friction was investigated during the capa: pr00502194 investigation. review of the controller log files associated with (b)(6) revealed a controller power up event on 24/may/2020 at 17:05:54. the data point prior to the loss of power revealed that a power adapter was connected to power port one (1) and (b)(6) was connected to power port two (2) with 95% relative state of charge (rsoc). the data point recorded after the loss of power revealed that (b)(6) was connected to power port one (1) and (b)(6) was connected to power port two (2). the controller was without power for 17 seconds. a vad stopped alarm was logged at 17:06:21 due to a failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. this was followed by two (2) vad disconnect alarms, indicating a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller, and an additional controller power up event at 17:17:14, likely due to troubleshooting. review of the controller log files associated with (b)(6) revealed a controller power up event on 24/may/2020 at 17:14:54. review of the event log file revealed that, prior to the first power up event, the controller last had power on (b)(6)2019, indicating that the power up event occurred during a controller exchange. a vad disconnect alarm was logged at 17:14:59 due to the controller powering up without a driveline connected. a vad stopped alarm was then logged at 17:15:33 due to a failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. a successful motor start event was then logged at 17:17:42 on (b)(6) after a controller exchange and the controller remained in use. additionally, review of the controller log files associated with (b)(6) revealed a controller power up event on 10/jun/2020 at 08:38:38. the data point prior to the loss of power revealed that (b)(6) was connected to power port one (1) with 98% rsoc and (b)(6) was connected to power port two (2) with 88% rsoc. the data point recorded after the loss of power revealed that (b)(6) was connected to power port one (1) and no power source was connected to power port two (2). the controller was without power 10 seconds. a vad disconnect alarm was then logged at 08:38:50 followed by two more controller power up events, which were likely due to troubleshooting. an analysis of the alarm file revealed that this vad disconnect alarm was most likely a false alarm, given that the speed recorded at the onset of the alarm was higher than the set speed. this indicates that a possible loss of synchronization of commutation occurred. commutation is the process of switching winding current to generate motion. if the pump rotational speed drifts higher than the speed set-point, the motor voltage will decrease to achieve the desired speed. however, if there is no change to the speed (speed reading remains frozen), the voltage will continue to decrease to zero. this likely caused the current to decrease to zero, triggering a vad disconnect alarm, even if the driveline was still physically connected to the controller. a vad stopped alarm was logged at 08:41:15 due to a failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. this was followed by additional controller power up events, vad stopped alarms and vad disconnect alarms, likely due to troubleshooting. log file analysis revealed that a controller exchange was performed to (b)(6) and a vad stopped alarm was logged on 10/jun/2020 at 08:51:43 indicating a failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. this was also followed by additional controller power up events, vad stopped alarms, and vad disconnect alarms likely due to troubleshooting. of note, review of the log files revealed high power consumption recorded during the failure to restart attempts. furthermore, several power disconnect alarms were observed involving (b)(6)on controllers (b)(6). during the power disconnect alarms, a safety alert word (saw) value was recorded indicating an overcurrent alert. at the time of the power disconnect alarms with an overcurrent alert, the alarm log recorded high power consumption, indicating a higher current consumption from the battery. the batteries were most likely physically disconnected, causing the controller to log these events as a power disconnect alarm. log file analysis also revealed 9 critical battery alarms involving (b)(6) starting at 11:58:18 on (b)(6) 2020 due to the battery depleting below 10% relative state of charge (rsoc). no low flow alarms, communication errors, or controller fault alarms were observed during the analyzed period. as a result, the reported controller loss of power event, vad stopped alarms, vad disconnect alarms, power disconnect alarms, high power consumption and critical battery alarms were confirmed; however, the reported low flow, communication errors, and controller fault alarms could not be confirmed. based on the available information, a possible root cause of the vad disconnect alarm associated with (b)(6) on (b)(6) 2020 at 08:38:50 can be attributed to a loss of synchronization of commutation, leading to a false vad disconnect alarm. capa: pr00550440 is investigating controller losses of synchronization of commutation. a possible root cause of the on (b)(6) 2020 loss of power associated with (b)(6) can be attributed to a disconnection of both power sources and/or to an intermittent disconnection on both power sources. the most likely root cause of the on (b)(6) 2020 loss of power event associated with (b)(6) can be attributed to the reported disconnection of both power sources from the controller, as described in the event details. capa: pr00551638 is investigating controller losses of power. a possible root cause of the reported power disconnect alarms may be attributed, but not limited, to a physical disconnection of the power source. the most likely root cause of the additional vad disconnect alarms can be attributed to a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller. the most likely root cause of the critical battery alarms can be attributed to the patient allowing the batteries to deplete below 10%. the most likely root cause of the vad stopped alarms can be attributed to failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. (b)(6) is part of fca cvg-21-q3-21. capa: pr00502194 is investigating pump failures to restart. based on the available information, the device may have caused or contributed to the reported event. per the instructions for use, device thrombus, bleeding, and worsening heart failure are known potential complications associated with the implantation of a vad. based on review of past adverse events for this patient, the patient did not have a history of similar adverse events. possible clinical factors that may have contributed to this event include the patient¿s pre-existing history and related comorbidities, the progression of their underlying disease, issues related to the therapeutic use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications and the patient's complex post-operative course. there are possible patient, pharmacological and procedural factors that may have contributed to this event. additional products: d4: lot#: 17409364-1276, h6: fda method code(s): b01, b15 h6: fda results

evaluation. various analyses were conducted and reviewed in order to evaluate the performance of the returned devices in relation to the reported event. failure analysis of (b)(6) revealed that the batteries passed visual inspection. functional testing revealed abnormalities related to the relative state of charge (rsoc); the batteries did not estimate the capacity accurately. this is an additional observation not related to the reported event, which can be attributed to an estimation error. failure analysis of (b)(6) revealed that the controller passed visual inspection and functional testing. failure analysis of (b)(6) revealed that the controller passed functional testing. visual inspection revealed contamination within power port two of the controller. this is an additional finding not related to the reported event, likely due to the handling of the device. the controller performed as expected and no damage was observed. as a result, the reported controller damage event was not confirmed. log file analysis revealed that (b)(6) was the patient's primary controller. analysis of the event log file associated with (b)(6) revealed a controller power up event logged on (b)(6)2020 at 19:16:10. the data point prior to the loss of power revealed that (b)(6) was connected to power port one with 24% relative state of charge (rsoc) and a power adapter was connected to power port two. the data point recorded after the loss of power revealed that (b)(6) was connected to power port one and a power adapter was connected to power port two. no anomalies were recorded leading up to the loss of power. the controller was without power for 16 seconds. analysis of (b)(6) alarm log file revealed two (2) vad stop alarms were logged on (b)(6)2020 at 19:16:37 and 19:20:12, due to a failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. additionally, two (2) additional controller power up event an vad disconnect alarm were logged starting at 19:17:37, likely due to troubleshooting and/or controller exchange from (b)(6). analysis of controller log files associated with (b)(6) revealed two (2) controller power up event logged on (b)(6)2020 at 19:23:48 and 19:24:37 and a vad disconnect alarm logged at 19:23:54. review of the event log file revealed that, prior to the first power up event, the controller last had power on (b)(6)2019. additionally, review of the data log file revealed that the controller (b)(4) was not in use prior to the first controller power up event; no data points had been logged since (b)(6)2019 and the first data point logged on (b)(6)2020, at 19:24:22, indicating that the power up events and vad disconnect alarm occurred during the controller exchange from (b)(6). this was followed by a vad stopped alarm was logged at 19:24:52 due to a failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. an additional vad disconnect alarm was logged at 19:26:13, likely due to troubleshooting and/or a controller exchange. as a result, the reported loss of power, vad stopped and failure to restart events were confirmed; however, the reported pump damaged event could not be confirmed. a possible root cause of the loss of power can be attributed to a disconnection of both power sources and/or to an intermittent disconnection on one or both power sources. a possible root cause of the vad stopped alarms can be attributed to a failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. based on historical review of similar events, the likely contributing cause of the failure of the pump to restart after several attempts was the inability of the pump-start <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> to provide sufficient torque to overcome abnormally high mechanical re sistance caused by unknown conditions that existed prior to

(con316680 and con316681) were returned for evaluation. the ventricular assist device (vad) pump was not returned for evaluation. various analyses were conducted and reviewed in order to evaluate the performance of the devices in relation to the reported event. failure analysis of the returned controller (con316681) revealed that the device passed visual inspection and functional testing. failure analysis of the returned controller (con316680) revealed that the device passed functional testing. visual inspection revealed contamination on both power ports. this is an additional finding, not related to the reported event, likely due to the handling of the device. review of the controller log files associated with con316680 revealed several electrical fault, high watt, vad stopped and vad disconnect alarms logged on 23-jul-2020. three (3) electrical fault alarms were logged beginning at 00:30:21 due to an open phase in the rear stator, causing the pump to run on the front stator only. in addition, multiple reactivation events were recorded in the event file due to the open phase in the rear stator. this likely triggered the subsequent high watt alarms due to the increased power consumption required to run on a single stator. a vad disconnect alarm was then logged at 01:05:38 indicating a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller. a controller power-up event was logged at 01:06:52. the data point prior to the loss of power revealed that a power adapter was connected to power port one and a battery was connected to power port two with 95% relative state of charge (rsoc). the data point recorded after the loss of power revealed that a battery was connected to power port one and the same battery from before the loss of power was connected to power port two. the controller was without power for 56 seconds. an electrical fault alarm was simultaneously logged at 01:06:52 due to multiple open phases on the rear stator. a vad stopped alarm was logged at 01:07:11 indicating a failure of the pump to restart after multiple attempts. at the time of the vad stop alarm, the rear stator was not connected due to multiple open phases while the front stator was connected normally; however, the pump was unable to start successfully on the front stator only. this was followed by several additional controller power up events likely due to troubleshooting of the device, in addition to several electrical fault and vad stopped alarms. review of the controller log files associated with con316681 revealed a controller power up event on 23-jul-2020 at 01:23:47. additionally, review of the data log file revealed that the controller was not in use prior to the controller power up event; the first data point since 12-dec-2018 was logged at 01:24:20 on 23-jul-2020, indicating that the power up event occurred during a controller exchange, which corresponds with the reported event details. an electrical fault alarm was logged at 01:23:48 due to multiple open phases on the rear stator. a vad stopped alarm was then logged at 01:24:03 indicating a failure of the pump to restart after multiple attempts. at the time of the vad stop alarm, the rear stator was not connected due to multiple open phases while the front stator was connected normally; however, the pump was unable to start successfully on the front stator only. this was followed by several additional controller power up events and vad disconnect alarms likely due to troubleshooting of the device, in addition to several electrical fault and vad stopped alarms. as a result, the reported event was confirmed. based on the risk documentation and available information, a possible root cause of the electrical fault alarms can be attributed, but not limited, to contamination by foreign material of the driveline connector, a marginal connection between the driveline cable and the controller, a vad malfunction, or a driveline connector malfunction. the most likely root cause of the vad disconnect alarms can be attributed to a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller. a possible root cause of the losses of power can be attributed to a disconnection of both power sources and/or to an intermittent disconnection on one or both power sources. the most likely root cause of the vad stopped alarms can be attributed to failure of the pump to restart after several attempts. based on historical review of similar events, the likely contributing causes for failure to restart may be attributed to multiple factors including but not limited to attempts to start the pump in a single stator condition and/or the inability of the pump-start <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> to provide sufficient torque to overcome abnormally high mechanical resistance

being that the situation was deemed potentially critical. several atte mpts were made to contact the clinic without success along with the patient¿s spouse. approximately one and a half hour later the clinic called, and a continuous high priority alarm was heard in the background along with the news that the vad had not restarted after the controller was exchanged. an attempt was made to switch to the previous primary controller, but this attempt was also unsuccessful. upon reviewing the patient¿s condition and clinical signs, the patient was stable and had adequate perfusion and good blood pressure; the patient was transferred to intensive care unit (icu). despite multiple attempts under a variety of conditions, a restart could not be achieved. the medical team was consulted several times to discuss a variety of options, such as a vad exchange or termination of vad therapy. since the patient was stable, it was decided to preform further <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b>s and appropriate imaging to make further decisions based on this information. the vad replacement was probably out of the question by this time, in part due to the patient¿s history of previous neurologic disease. a decision was made to perform a restart attempt with the new software by updating a controller via the monitor the following day. the necessary documents such as acknowledgment form, patient consent form and a sp ecial permit were sent to the responsible physician; along with new controllers and batteries in which were transferred from another hospital. despite several attempts, different settings on the new controller, two fully charged new batteries and ac adapter, the vad did not restart.  log files from the new controller were not taken after the restart attempts. a computerized tomography (ct) scan was performed with contrast to evaluate if there was any flow in the outflow graft (ofg) or vad and revealed no thrombus in the ofg. no statement could be made about the flow through the vad. therapy was considered terminated, but closure of the outflow graft by occlusion or ligation was not performed. the patient was stable even after treatment requiring only optimized heart failure medication and the driveline was cut off..it was reported that one controller exhibited a real time clock error and was exchanged. after the exchange to a second controller, the ventricular assist device (vad) failed to restart and the second controller and vad were removed from service. it was also reported that a battery exhibited an erroneous critical battery alarm that was associated with a communication error that was shown in the logfiles. it was also reported that the battery had a defective port. the battery was removed from service. no patient complications have been reported as a result of this event.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:### a supplemental report is being submitted for an update to the product event summary: h6. eval code method (fdm/annex b) for the vad. product event summary: the ventricular assist device (vad) ((b)(6)) was not returned for evaluation. three (3) controllers (b)(6), and four (4) batteries (b)(6) were returned for evaluation. review of the vad's manufacturing documentation confirmed that the associated device met all requirements for release. various analyses were conducted and reviewed in order to evaluate the performance of the returned devices in relation to the reported event. failure analysis of (b)(6) and (b)(6) revealed the controllers passed visual inspection and functional testing. failure analysis of the batteries revealed that the devices passed functional testing; the batteries were able to able to connect securely to a test controller and properly provide power. visual inspection of the batteries revealed wear to the connector of the batteries; however, the observed damage did not affect the functionality of the devices. failure analysis of (b)(6) revealed slightly bent pins within both power ports. despite the bent pins, a battery was still able to connect to the controller. additionally, visual inspection revealed contamination within both power ports of the controller. the observed contamination within the controller ports event is an additio nal finding not related to the reported event and can be attributed to the handling of the device. functional testing of (b)(6) revealed that the controller was unable to communicate with external power sources and the display was not showing information, resulting in critical battery alarms. additionally, the controller exhibited cyclical controller reset events. however, the controller was still able to receive power from power sources and supply power to a motor fixture. internal inspection of the controller revealed a damaged diode on the communication line and a damaged integrated circuit which are responsible for the communication between the controller and batteries. the damaged integrated circuit is connected to the user interface controller (uic) responsible for the operations of the controller; the damaged integrated circuit prevented the controller from reading battery information and caused the controller to trigger the critical battery alarms, as well as the controller reset events observed in the controller log files. the damaged integrated circuit is also connected to the real time clock circuit and caused the date/time stamp to remain frozen. log file analysis revealed that (b)(6) was the patient's primary controller, initially in use during the reported event. review of the alarm log file associated with (b)(6) revealed a critical battery alarm involving (b)(6) logged with an incorrect date stamp, battery capacity, id, or cycle count, indicating that the controller was unable to properly communicate with the connected battery. review of the alarm log file associated with (b)(6) also revealed several critical battery alarms logged with an incorrect date stamp, battery capacity, id, or cycle count, indicating that the controller was unable to recognize the connected batteries. several vad disconnect alarms were also logged with the incorrect time/date stamp, indicating physical disconnections of the driveline from the controller, likely during a controller exchange and/or an attempt at troubleshooting. in addition, three (3) vad stopped alarms were logged with an incorrect date stamp, battery capacity, id, or cycle count, indicating that the pump failed to restart after multiple attempts. analysis of the alarm log file did not reveal any power disconnect alarms; however, review of data log file associated with (b)(6) revealed multiple data points with a battery relative state of charge (rsoc) value of either 0% or 101% logged with incorrect date/time stamps and no serial number ids or cycle counts, indicating that the controller was unable to recognize the connected batteries. instances with the batteries' relative state of charge (rsoc) values logged between 101-201 are indicative of communication errors. a communication error will trigger a power disconnect alarm if the other power source has an rsoc greater than 25%. review of the event log file associated with (b)(6) revealed several controller power ups logged with an incorrect time/date stamp, likely due to troubleshooting of the controller and/or a controller exchange. review of (b)(6) event log file also revealed multiple controller reset events with incorrect date and time stamps. review of the controller log files associated with (b)(6) revealed a controller power up event logged on (b)(6) 2022 18:51:01, indicating that the controller was put into use following the reported controller exchange. additionally, a subsequent vad disconnect alarms was logged at 18:51:08 indicating the controller was powered on without the driveline connected. review of the alarm log file associated with (b)(6) revealed a vad stopped alarm logged on (b)(6) 2022 at 18:51:35, indicating that the pump failed to restart after several attempts. this vad stopped alarm was followed by additional controller power up events, additional vad stopped alarms indicating that the pump failed to restart after several attempts, and an additional vad disconnect alarm due to a physical disconnection of the driveline from the controller, likely due to troubleshooting. review of the controller log files associated with (b)(6) revealed three (3) controller power up events logged on (b)(6) 2022 at 13:07:38, 13:15:30, and 13:22:49, due to the initial set up of the controller and that the controller was put into use. review of the alarm log file associated with (b)(6) revealed a vad stopped alarm logged on (b)(6) 2022 at 13:28:07, indicating that the pump failed to restart after several attempts. this vad stopped alarm was followed by additional controller power up events and additional vad stopped alarms indicating that the pump failed to restart after several attempts, likely due to troubleshooting. (b)(6) was loaded with a software containing an unapproved pump start <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>. as a result, the reported events were confirmed. based on an investigation conducted under capa pr00384004, the root cause of observed bent socket pins within power port connectors is attributed to misalignment during connection attempts between the metal receptacles on the controller and the plastic connector plugs in the battery and/or adapter cables, which likely contributed to the reported event. the misalignment results in wear on the connector plugs that can lead to contact between the connector plug and socket pins from the controller. the socket pins may not withstand applied forces from subsequent misaligned connections, causing the pins to bend. based on the available information, the most likely root cause of the observed damage to the power source connectors can be attributed to wear, likely due to normal disconnection and reconnection between the power sources' output cables and metal power port connectors on the controller. capa pr00384004 was opened to investigate bent/damaged pins with controller 2.0 and damaged cable connectors. the most likely root cause of the reported real time clock errors, critical battery alarm, inability of the controller to recognize the batteries, display error, communication errors, power disconnect alarms, and observed controller reset events can be attributed to a damaged diode and damaged integrated circuit. a possible root cause for the damaged diode and integrated circuit on the communication line can be attributed to a voltage spike on the communication pin of the connector. capa pr00465502 was opened to investigate this issue. the most likely root cause of the observed vad disconnect alarms can be attributed to physical disconnections of the driveline from the controller during the controller exchange and troubleshooting of the vad stopped alarms. the most likely root cause of the controller power up events involving the controllers can be attributed to a controller exchange and troubleshooting of the vad stopped alarms. the most likely root cause of the reported vad stopped alarms can be attributed to failure of the pump to restart after several attempts.

found when compiling the final, full-data report by certified cardiographic technician. due to the delay in the notification, the patient experienced a delay in treatment which resulted in the patient being hospitalized due to a syncopal episode.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:the investigation was unable to determine the cause of the reported issue. during the final report process an additional finding for doctor notification was found, which fell within notification criteria, but was not transmitted to the account. no other performance or functional issues were found around the time of the alleged event..the patient was hospitalized approximately 11 days after the prescribed wear-period due to experiencing a delay in treatment. a cardiac event that met the device¿s automatic detection feature occurred on (b)(6) 2022 at 02:07:21 pm, during the wear-period, however the event was not transmitted to irhythm servers. on 23-jul-2022, the device was returned to irhythm for processing. during processing of the final report, (b)(6) 2022 irhythm discovered the un-transmitted cardiac event; a 4.2-second pause. the account was notified later the same day. on (b)(6) 2022 the patient was hospitalized due to syncope/collapse and received a pacemaker on (b)(6) 2022. an analysis of the <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> data was completed and confirmed the device was consistently transmitting during the wear-period. the most likely cause of the missed episode transmission is a potential <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> sensitivity issue. per the patient¿s provider, this event caused a delay in treatment. the zio at ecg monitoring system is intended to capture, analyze and report symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiac events and continuous electrocardiogram (ecg) information for long-term monitoring. while continuously recording patient ecg, both patient-triggered and automatically detected arrhythmia events are transmitted to a monitoring center for reporting. after wear, a final report is generated based on beat-to-beat information from the entire ecg recording. it is indicated for use on patients 18 years or older who may be asymptomatic or who may suffer from transient symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, light-headedness, pre-syncope, syncope, fatigue, or anxiety. the reports are provided

2014;123:191-198. doi: 10.1016/j.clineuro.2014.05.012. summary: in this study, we assessed the outcomes of patients with dystonia who underwent surgery treatment following the same <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>. eighty consecutive patients with dystonia were submitted to neurosurgical management by means of intrathecal pump implantation, pallidotomy or deep brain stimulation (gpi or vim). these patients included 48 patients with primary dystonia and 32 patients with secondary dystonia. burke¿fahn¿marsden dystonia rating scale (bfmdrs) was used to access pre- and postoperative outcomes. patients were followed from 12 to 114 months. mean improvement in bfmdrs score among patients with prd was 87.54% and 42.21% for sed. hemidystonic patients in both groups (prd, sed) showed a mean improvement in bfmdrs of 71.05% with gpidbs. patients with sed due to previous perinatal insults showed a mean improvement in bfmdrs of 41.9%, with better results in purely dyskinetic patients (mean improvement of 61.2%). use of the proposed <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> facilitated surgical decision planning, which translated in improved <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> rates, earlier interventions, appropriate management plans, and outcomes for both groups (prd, sed). therefore, neuroimaging findings had a positive prognostic significance in the response to treatment in patients with primary dystonia compared with patients with secondary dystonia or distortion of basal ganglia anatomy. however, further studies in this line are warranted. reported events: 1. 1 patient experienced hardware-related rupture-fracture of a system part, which required additional corrective surgeries. the reporter stated that the patient

management. anesth analg. 2017;124(4):1304-1310. doi: (b)(6). summary: analysis of closed malpractice claims allows the study of rare but serious complications and likely results in improved patient safety by raising awareness of such complications. clinical studies and closed claims analyses have previously reported on the common complications associated with intrathecal drug delivery systems (idds) and spinal cord stimulators (scs). this study provides a contemporary analysis of claims from within the past 10 years. we performed a closed claims analysis for a period january 1, 2009 to december 31, 2013 for cases with pain medicine as the primary service. these cases were identified using the controlled risk insurance company (crico) comparative benchmarking system (cbs), a database containing more than 300,000 malpractice claims from more than 400 academic and community institutions, representing approximately 30% of malpractice cases in the united states. the clinical narratives, which included medical files, claims files, depositions, and expert witness testimony, were reviewed by the authors, as were the crico coded variables, which included <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>ically determined contributing factors to the patient injury. reported events: the chronic pain <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> for idds (intrathecal drug delivery system) implantation included 5 cases of failed back surgery syndrome, 5 cases of degenerative joint disease with lumbar radiculopathy, 3 cases of spasticity, one case of complex regional pain syndrome, one case of malignancy, one case of cerebrovascular infarct-triggered central pain, and one case was not available. there were five cases of idds (intrathecal drug delivery system) refill errors. these alleged damaging events included a relatively benign case wherein an intentional idds dose increase was judged to be within the standard of care resulted in patient sedation. other cases included accidental subcutaneous injection of 100 mcg/ml sufentanil by a registered nurse in an obese patient with abdominal scar tissue, an accidental 6-fold intrathecal medication dose increase performed by a medical assistant, and an accidental 20-fold dose increase performed by a physician. the medium severity outcomes included drug reactions, all from pump refill errors and ranged from somnolence to respiratory arrest requiring intensive care unit admission and naloxone infusion. there were three cases of intrathecal granuloma. intrathecal granuloma formation was marked in all cases by a decreased analgesic effect despite an increased dose of intrathecal medications. <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> interventions were delayed until after neurologic deficits had developed. involved agents included intrathecally delivered morphine and, in 1 case, methadone. there were two cases of pulmonary embolism. the cases had a high-severity outcome of death, which were attributed to pulmonary embol i. there were two cases of post-operative infection. the events included soft tissue and epidural abscess formation related most often to the infection surrounding a device component. in one case, a patient who went swimming against medical advice after idds implantation developed pseudomonas meningitis. there was one case of intra-operative nerve damage. there was one case of epidural hematoma. there was one case of a defective device (recalled). there was one case of post-operative mechanical damage to the device. there were three cases with a high-severity outcome of nerve damage. these nerve damage outcomes ranged from it (intrathecal) granuloma-related paraplegia and epidural abscess-related quadriplegia requiring tracheostomy, enteric feeding tube, and placement in long-term care facility. there were three cases with a medium-severity outcome which needed re-operation, most commonly because of the retained device component or infection. there were two cases with a medium-severity outcome of nerve damage. there was one case with a medium-severity outcome of same/worse symptoms. complaints of no improvement or worsening of symptoms (eg, pain, urinary incontinence) were a common outcome. the contributing factors, as coded by crico (controlled risk insurance company), were noted as 8 cases of technical skill, 5 cases of clinical judgement, 2 cases of communication, 2 cases of documentation, 2 cases of patient behavior, 2 cases of supervision of staff or supervision of trainee, 3 cases of equipment-related, and one case of no

1.52 and 1.04 s/co were generated for a pregnant patient on (b)(6) 2012. the patient delivered her baby on (b)(6) 2012. due to the reported repeat reactive results for hbsag, the baby was unnecessarily given a hepatitis b vaccine at the time of birth. the physician ordered a panel of tests (hcv, core-m, havab-m and hbsag) the following day and all results were nonreactive. confirmatory testing was negative, but was not received by the physician before the birth of the baby. the customer stated that the mother and baby are doing well with no complications from the vaccine.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:a review of manufacturing records did not identify any issues related to the complaint issue. complaint review determined that there is no unusual activity for reagent lot 17507lf00 for issues of repeat (b)(6) results for a single patient sample. the complaint trending report review shows no adverse trend for the issue. there is no malfunction as when the sample was tested with the confirmatory assay per the package insert testing <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>, it was not confirmed, and also a subsequent re-test for (b)(6) was non reactive. the architect (b)(6) confirmatory package insert states that the interpretation of not confirmed for (b)(6) indicates the presence of (b)(6) cannot be confirmed via neutralization. the repeatedly reactive result obtained with the architect (b)(6) assay may be the result of a nonspecific reaction (false reactive). as the presence of nonspecific binding may obscure low levels of (b)(6) in the specimen due to early infection or early recovery, it is recommended that the patient be evaluated for other serologic markers of (b)(6) infection (i.e. total anti (b)(6) or igm anti-(b)(6)) and that the patient be re-tested for (b)(6) in 4 to 6 weeks. in this case it should be noted that the customer assessed the patient sample using a core-m (b)(6) marker and a non-reactive result was returned. complaint investigation has concluded that the architect (b)(6) qualitative ii reagent, lot 17507lf00 is performing acceptably. no product deficiency was identified and no additional issues were identified during the investigation..an evaluation is in process. a follow-up report will be submitted when the evaluation is complete.

bcid-gp panel (cartridge id c4000054839, lot # 53274702) reported no targets detected. their standard-of-care <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> identified streptococcus salivarius/vestibularis in subculture with identification by maldi-tof. as part of the investigation of the eplex bcid-gp panel discrepant result, the raw data from the eplex bcid-gp panel test run was analyzed indicating the streptococcus genus target had signal present but below the established assay cutoff. on (b)(4) 2019 (b)(4) customer technical support communicated this analysis to the customer. the customer followed up with (b)(4) customer technical support on (b)(4) and reported that the patient passed away. the customer stated that additional maldi-tof testing in conjunction with the eplex bcid-gp panel was taken into consideration for the patient treatment plan and that based on their lab's reporting protocol, their treatment plan was not affected by the eplex bcid-gp panel result. internal review of qc data for the bcid-gp panel (lot 53274702) confirms that the affected lot appropriately met qc release specifications. conclusion: review of the following information suggests that the bcid-gp panel performed as intended and within specification: review of the qc release data from the affected lot confirms that the lot successfully met the established qc release specifications. review of the bcid-gp panel test run information demonstrates that the internal controls were valid. no run malfunction was observed and the eplex instrument (serial #1708100180) was working within design specifications. the investigation concluded that the most likely cause for this discrepant result was a difference in sensitivity between the eplex bcid-gp panel and the standard-of-care test methods. background: the eplex bcid-gp panel streptococcus result is based on five assays: the species-specific streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosus group, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes assays and a broad streptococcus assay. the streptococcus salivarius organism is expected to be detected yielding an eplex streptococcus detected result. during panel development, four strains of streptococcus salivarius were tested to assess analytical reactivity and found to be inclusive at a concentration ranging from 1 x 10^8 to 4 x 10^8 cfu/ml (table 56, eplex bcid-gp panel package insert). additionally, in silico analysis predicted detection for greater than 95% of target sequences for streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis. (table 65, eplex bcid-gp panel package insert). the overall clinical sensitivity of the bcid-gp panel for detecting streptococcus was established to be 97.4% (95% ci: 95.0%-98.6%). for clinical samples that contained either streptococcus salivarius or streptococcus vestibularis by the comparator test method, the eplex bcid-gp panel demonstrated robust performance with 100% sensitivity, including one sample that was polymicrobial (tables 43 & 53, eplex bcid-gp package insert). the investigation concluded that the most likely cause for this discrepant result was a difference in sensitivity between the eplex bcid-gp panel and the standard-of-care test methods. incorrect results are an identified risk to health identified within fda class ii special controls guideline: multiplex nucleic acid assay for identification of microorganisms and resistance markers from positive blood cultures (may, 2015) and within (b)(4)'s product risk management file. the eplex bcid-gp panel was appropriately used according to the product's intended use, which describes the assay as an aid in the <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> of bloodstream infection when used in conjunction with other clinical information. the results from the eplex bcid-gp panel are intended to be interpreted in conjunction with gram stain results and should not be used as the sole basis for <b

Comments</b>:follow-up information was received on 22-jan-2021: the author confirmed that the biopsy was performed mainly because the patient did not know which kind of material was used. with the histopathology analysis, the authors only saw a difference between hyaluronic acid and other materials. it was not possible to make out the difference between brands. the outcome of the events remained unchanged..this report concerns an exemplary case of 1 of 26 female patients (42-81 years old). this is a literature report from a retrospective review of 26 patients who underwent a biopsy for facial nodule formation following filler injections, to determine the <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> of the nodule and type of filler used. this literature report from (b)(6) concerns a female patient. she was injected by a different injector with hyaluronic acid. as reported, the patients had 3 different types of fillers at the same or adjacent sites. after the treatment with hyaluronic acid, the patient experienced a localized induration with or without pain at the site of the filler injection. as reported, more than 3 months after the treatment with hyaluronic acid, the patient presented with facial nodule formation, with different localizations including the lip, nasolabial folds, cheeks, infraorbital region, glabella, temporal region and chin. before proposing a treatment, the patient underwent a punch or surgical biopsy to determine the <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> of the nodule and to identify the type of filler. the histopathological analysis revealed a granulomatous nodule and a non-granulomatous nodule. as reported for granulomas, some macrophages underwent fusion and then formed multinucleated giant cells. by contrast, nongranulomatous nodules were an inert accumulation of a foreign body without an inflammatory reaction. concerning the type of filler the histopathological pattern included a nonbirefringent, nontranslucent basophile flakes without any particles, compatible with hyaluronic acid. all 4 non-granulomatous nodules contained only hyaluronic acid and 2 sites showed a granulomatous nodule with hyaluronic acid. the nongranulomatous nodule, with a hyaluronidase injection, resolved completely. for granulomatous nodules containing hyaluronic acid, as hyaluronidase injection was not sufficient, and a surgical resection of the remaining granuloma was performed. the outcome of the event non-granulomatous nodules was reported as resolved. due to the provided information, the outcome of the event granulomatous nodule was considered as resolving. the outcome of the events pain and localized induration was unknown. in the opinion of the authors, late adverse events were more prone to occur with permanent or semi-absorbable fillers. unfortunately, in many cases, the patient did not remember which product was injected. histopathological analysis was essential to confirm the <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> of granuloma and to identify the product used. it allowed the surgeon to differentiate granuloma from a normal foreign body reaction and hence improve the treatment <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:this case was assessed as reportable to the fda as the event, granulomatous nodule, was deemed to meet serious injury criteria of necessitated medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage of a body structure. the device history record could not be reviewed as the lot number was not reported. citation: ali modarressi, christophe nizet, tommaso lombardi, granulomas and nongranulomatous nodules after filler injection: different complications require

natus distributor & (b)(6), reported to natus technical service that an infant patient was screened on the algo3i and had passed screening on both ears in (b)(6) 2017. the patient has since been reported to have been diagnosed with complete hearing loss in both ears. the (b)(6) also mentioned there was a history of major hearing loss in infant's family.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:it was documented that the patient had been screened on both ears, and the patient has since been reported to have been diagnosed with complete hearing loss in both ears, despite the algo 3i registering a passing result. it was also noted that there was a history of major hearing loss in the infant's family, and no other risk factors have been reported to natus medical. audiological evaluations which determined hearing loss were also not provided to natus. an expanded audiological evaluation was conducted by natus clinical following servicing of the device. it has been determined that the unit contained a faulty printed circuit board and a defective led screen, both of which have been replaced. all other device elements have been tested by natus engineering and have been found to be within the required specifications. crosstalk between the ata cables, which can produce synchronous noise, was the reasoning for replacing the circuit board. it has been determined that the noise generated from the digital board could have caused the <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> to give a suspect result. if the printed circuit board was faulty at the time of screening, the test screen should be judged as invalid, and a pass/refer conclusion cannot be reached as the results are inconclusive. while we cannot determine if the faulty circuit board caused the false pass result or the time of onset of the patient's clinical outcome, it could be suggested that the device may have been responsible for the false pass or false refer results during the testing, discounting other factors. based upon the available information, clinical data described, and the questionable functionality of the faulty printed circuit board, it is not possible to specify how passing results were obtained for both ears. results obtained with a faulty circuit board are deemed invalid. based on a strong family history of hearing loss, with unknown origin, it is not possible to determine if the hearing loss was present at the time of birth, delayed onset or progressive in nature. the goals of screening and the recommendations of the joint committee on infant hearing 2007 emphasize the need for <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> by three months of age, which had been accomplished, therefore the benchmark of identification has been met. follow-up intervention had already been initiated, despite the questionable results from the initial screening. the algo 3i hearing screener has since been put back into service and has been confirmed to function according to product requirements. the initial results taken should be disregarded, as the accuracy of the results is questionable due to the confirmed issues with the device functionality. this information has been communicated to the customer..the algo 3i was returned to the (b)(6), where the device took approximately one minute to pass the equipment test. the ata cable passed the acoustic check and an "orange blob" was observed on the led screen. the asc performed further tests, and upon calibrating the ata cable, the equipment test passed in approximately 36 seconds. the led screen with the "orange blob" had been changed. a noise test was performed and failed. the asc replaced the suspected unit digital board and the noise test passed. the algo 3i has been returned to natus for further investigation, including the parts that have been replaced.</p><hr><h3 id="ALG-DIAG-286">Result ALG-DIAG-286</h3><p><a href="https://api.fda.gov/device/event.json?search=algorithm*+AND+(diagnostic*+OR+diagnosis*)&limit=500&skip=1000"

test. the customer was concerned that the package insert instructions for test interpretation had changed. in investigating the issue, it was noted that the multispot test interpretation section was not changed in the package insert between the march 2013 and may 2014 versions. the customer mistakenly assumed that the interpretation instructions in section 11 were the only interpretation instructions; customer was not aware of the interpretation instructions in section 14. section 14 should have been followed to interpret the test since the test is run as part of the <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>. technical support advised the customer that the different interpretation instructions being described by each interpretation section, are for using the test as a screening test and using the test as part of the <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>, respectively. the customer reported that they have been using the multispot test as part of the <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> since (b)(6) 2013. customer reported that they conducted a competency assessment of the technicians running the test and found only one technician was referring to the wrong package insert section for multispot interpretation; this technician has been retrained. customer conducted an assessment of the 160 samples that were reported as (b)(6). for 134 of the samples, the customer had a record of the spot used to report the results. twenty-two of the remaining 26 samples had a viral load or other test results available for reference. one of the remaining samples was reported as (b)(6) and the spot data recorded showed one (b)(6), not both spots. nat testing results were (b)(6) rna detected (by qualitative tma from wadsworth nysdoh. customer also received another sample collected from the patient which was tested on multispot and showed spots for both (b)(6) ab spots. customer stated the initial multispot report has been corrected and the provider notified of the interpretation error. one of the other patients had an appointment for a redraw on (b)(6) 2015, but they did not come to the appointment. the customer will check their county (b)(6) program to see if there is any additional information available for these three remaining patients. the remaining three patients are still on the customer's radar and will be discussed at the customer's next quality review meeting that will include the std controller. since results were released to the care providers and patients by the customer using the incorrect interpretation instructions for 160 patients, which lead to incorrect results being reported in at least one case. given that at least one case was incorrectly reported with others possible, a mdr is being submitted for this case.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:</p><hr><h3 id="ALG-DIAG-287">Result

complaint received a complaint that "tissue appears underprocessed, poor nuclear detail, smudged" following processing. the complainant advised that "greasy blue precipitate" was found in all reagent bottles designated for xylene; the reagent in bottles 1 (formalin); and 2 (formalin) was replaced on (b)(6) 2019; and on (b)(6) 2019 after observing the concentration dropped to 96% following completion of two (2) processing runs; the reagent change threshold for formalin has been changed to 98%; the reagent concentration for xylene has dropped from 100% to 78% following completion of two (2) processing runs with 358 cassettes; and anther reagent bottle designated for xylene was at a concentration of 97% after completion of eight (8) processing runs with 839 cassettes processed. on (b)(4) 2019, a leica applications specialist visited the customer site in order to obtain further information regarding the circumstances involved in this complaint, and to provide applications support. the leica applications specialist documented the following information: "technician went to change the lowest conc. alcohol and put in 100% but was distracted and changed the bottle in the software but did not actually replace the reagent with pure ethanol. this caused the instrument to use the bottle with the incorrect alcohol concentration last before moving on to xylene. because of this, the tissue wasn't adequately dehydrated prior to clearing and also contaminated the xylene with water. this resulted in underprocessed tissue. technician also appears to have abandoned a cleaning protocol before it ran to completion and then loaded another run on that same retort before the cleaning ethanol could evaporate. this resulted in a formalin bottle coming into contact with ethanol and degrading the quality of formalin prematurely." on (b)(4) 2019, leica biosystems received the following information from the laboratory: "we ended up having one case, a bladder, transurethral resection that was non-<b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> and re-biopsy was recommended". on (b)(4) 2019, leica biosystems was advised that the un-diagnosable case is from a (b)(6) years old male. the specimen was 4 x 1 x 1 mm in size. attempts to reprocess the tissue were unsuccessful.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:manufacturer evaluation of the instrument logs found that bottle 1 (formalin) was not in contact with the corresponding sensor for approximately 17 seconds at 12:21pm on (b)(6) 2019, which is not sufficient time to replace the reagent. a user manually set the concentration to 100% at 12:21pm on (b)(6) 2019. although the user affirmed in the instrument software that the reagent concentration in bottles 1 (formalin), was to be set to the default value of 100% at 12:21pm on (b)(6) 2019, the actual concentration of the reagent in bottle 1 (formalin) remains unchanged at 92.4% because bottle had been removed from the instrument for sufficient time to replace the reagent. the minimum recommended reagent concentration required for formalin is 98%. it is not possible to determine the impact of tissue samples having used formalin at a concentration less than the minimum recommended for the fixation step of the protocol. the reagent in bottle 1 (formalin) was used for the second time in the fixation step of the "factory 2hr xylene standard" protocol started in retort b at 21:35pm on (b)(6) 2019. based on the information provided, the tissue samples exhibiting sub-optimal tissue processing are derived from the "factory 2hr

sub-optimal tissue processing was identified. the root cause of the sub-optimal tissue processing reported by the complainant could not be determined from the information available. a contributing factor may have been a use error which occurred at 12:21pm on (b)(6) 2019. specifically, manual replacement of the reagent in bottle 1 (formalin) was not completed in accordance with the manufacturer instructions detailed in the leica peloris/peloris ll user manual. the leica peloris/peloris ll user manual contains the following specific warning: "always change reagents when prompted. always update station details correctly - never update the details without replacing the reagent. failure to follow these directives can lead to tissue damage or loss." the reagent in bottle 1 (formalin) was used for the second time in the fixation step of the "factory 2hr xylene standard" protocol started in retort b at 21:35pm on (b)(6) 2019. the root cause of the "greasy blue precipitate" was found in all reagent bottles designated for xylene could not be determined form the information available. the root cause of the drop in reagent concentration is likely to be the result of sub-optimal manual reagent management overlapping the instrument's own reagent management <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>s (e.g. stations properties being reset - that is number of cassettes and cycles reset - but

Comments</b>:it was reported that a peritoneal dialysis (pd) patient was diagnosed with peritonitis on (b)(6) 2020. upon follow up with the patient's pd registered nurse (pdrn), it was reported that the patient presented to their user facility with symptoms of stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and cloudy pd effluent. a pd effluent culture was obtained and grew positive for staphylococcus epidermidis and the patient was diagnosed with peritonitis. the patient was initiated on antibiotics per the clinic peritonitis <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> (drug, dose, route, frequency and duration unknown). the patient did not require hospitalization. the cause of the peritonitis has been attributed to a breach in aseptic technique. the patient continued with their prescribed pd prescription which utilizes continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (ccpd) on the liberty select cycler as well as a manual daytime exchange. the patient has recovered from the peritonitis event.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:clinical investigation: there is a temporal relationship between pd therapy on the liberty select cycler with cycler set and the patient event of stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and cloudy pd effluent with a subsequent <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> of peritonitis. however, there is no documentation in the complaint file to show a causal relationship between the event and use of the liberty select cycler with cycler set. per the pdrn, the cause of the peritonitis event was a breach in aseptic technique by the patient as evidenced by the culture result of staphylococcus epidermidis (staph epi). staph epi is the predominant normal flora on human skin. based on the available information and no allegation of a malfunction, deficiency or defect, the liberty select cycler and cycler set can be excluded as the cause of the patient¿s peritonitis event. plant investigation: as the device was not returned to the manufacturer, a physical evaluation could not be performed. a batch records review was conducted by the manufacturer for the reported lot. there were no non-conformances or abnormalities identified during the manufacturing process which could be associated with the reported event. the entire lot has been sold and distributed. in addition, a device history review was performed and confirmed that the results of the in-progress and final quality control (qc) testing met all requirements. the lot met all specifications for release. a product history review did not reveal a probable cause for the customer complaint. as a physical

1-10 (germany). the aim of this retrospective study was to investigate whether age influences the efficacy of locking plate osteosynthesis by comparing the functional outcomes of patients =65 years and <65 years. among the 131 patients (132 phfs) who underwent primary fracture fixation of a displaced phf with the titanium alloy philos plate (depuy synthes®; synthes gmbh, umkirch, germany), 79

age-independent clinical outcome in proximal humeral fractures: 2-year results using the example of a precontoured locking plate, journal of clinical medicine, vol. 11 (408), pages 1-10 (germany). the aim of this retrospective study was to investigate whether age influences the efficacy of locking plate osteosynthesis by comparing the functional outcomes of patients =65 years and <65 years. among the 131 patients (132 phfs) who underwent primary fracture fixation of a displaced phf with the titanium alloy philos plate (depuy synthes®; synthes gmbh, umkirch, germany), 79 patients were included in the study between january 2017 and january 2018. the cohort was divided into two groups: group 1 (=65 years) and group 2 (<65 years). group 1 consists of 42 patients (10 male and 32 female) with a mean age of 74.4±6.6 years (range: 65¿89 years) and mean follow-up time of 25 months (range: 19¿29 months). group 2 consists of 37 patients (17 male and 20 female) with a mean age of 52.9±8.9 years (range: 29¿65 years) and a mean follow-up time of 24 months (range: 14¿29 months). the following complications were reported as follows: among the excluded patients, 3 patients died. group 1: regarding the quality of fracture reduction, 18 patients had a malreduction. 3/20 cases had secondary screw perforation. 2 of these cases required revision surgery; one case was in the cement-augmented humeral head screw subgroup, and the other was in the subgroup without cement. 2/20 cases had a fragment displacement, both involving displacement of the greater tubercle. 2 patients had avascular necrosis. a 70-year-old female with a valgus-distracted four-part fracture experienced osteonecrosis of the humeral head 4 months after primary surgery and were treated using reverse shoulder arthroplasty. an 81-year-old female presented with osteonecrosis of the humeral head 5 months after primary plate osteosynthesis, and treatment was also switched to reverse shoulder arthroplasty. group 2: regarding the quality of fracture reduction, 11 patients had malreduction. 4/26 cases had a secondary screw perforation. 4 patients suffered an avascular humeral head necrosis, leading to three reverse arthroplasties and one anatomical shoulder arthroplasty. in two cases, divergent from the treatment <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>, humeral head-preserving reconstruction was performed even though both fractures had a humeral headsplit component. the other two cases showed a varus-distracted pattern with a severe commuted humeral head requiring allogeneic bone

administered heparin based on their high d-dimer result. the patient was administered a heparin bolus of 4000 iu and a heparin perfusor was run at 1000 iu/hr. the patient was later tested for activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) on the sysmex cs-2500 system (legal manufacture: sysmex) using siemens dade actin fs activated ptt reagent. the system gave a non-numeric result with a "no coagulation" flag, however, the customer incorrectly reported a numeric aptt result derived by the customer using the graph from the system and extrapolating a value, and subsequently the heparin perfusor was increased to 1200 iu/hr. 4-5 hours later, the patient developed swelling on her neck and shortness of breath, so she had to be intubated. ct morphology showed that the patient had a hematoma. aptt was then tested and the system gave a non-numeric result with a "no coagulation" flag. the customer manually derived a value to be higher than the initial result by using the graph from the system and extrapolating. heparin perfusion was then stopped. the patient was then tested again for aptt, and the system gave a non-numeric result with a "no coagulation" flag. the customer again

states (ous) customer contacted a siemens customer care center (ccc). although the sysmex cs2500 system displayed a flag "no coagulation" and did not give a numeric aptt result, the customer reported manually extrapolated numeric aptt results without the associated system flags. regarding the "no coagulation" flag: 0032.0000.0000 no coagulation, the following information is given within the instruction manual of the cs-2500 system: "possible cause: the coagulation reaction was not detectable, due to low fibrinogen concentration, an anticoagulant sample or a reagent problem. corrective actions/countermeasures: reanalyze and make a comprehensive judgment, taking sample and reagent, etc. into consideration. also, set a longer detection time and repeat the analysis." the cs-2500 evaluation and check <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> document contains the following: "action steps for "no coagulation" 1. check the sample for possible anticoagulant contamination, hemolysis, lipemia, etc. 2. verify delivery of sample and reagent. 3. reanalyze the sample. for fibrinogen, if auto re-dilution is not set, change the dilution ratio and reanalyze. 4. if reanalysis gives "no coagulation" message again, the sample is below the detection limits of the detector. use an alternate method to confirm the data. *do not report results without numerical values*" the issue was caused by a use error as the system gave no numeric results and flagged the measurement accordingly, but the customer manually estimated and reported results without the associated system flags. the physician could not definitively conclude the cause of the patient¿s death taking into consideration the patient¿s medical condition (lae (pulmonary artery embolism) ) and the bleeding complication due to the heparin overdose that occurred as a result of the aptt misidentification (or the subsequent high dosage of the heparin perfusor). the physician also pointed out that no value was incorrectly determined by the device. an employee of the laboratory manually extrapolated numeric aptt results and therefore issued a false aptt finding. the reagent is performing according to specifications. no further evaluation of this device is required. the siemens dade actin fs activated ptt reagent is marketed in the united states under material number 10445712. the 510(k) number

emboli. unk - a (b)(6) male patient started his second course of supartz bilaterally concluding a month before admission. he received his 4th injection of supartz to the knees. he was admitted to the hospital after waking up at 3:00 am with shortness of breath associated with sharp chest pain radiating to the right shoulder and back, which was made worse by deep inspiration and by coughing. unk - his physical exam was unremarkable other than shallow rapid breaths and a pulse of 99 beats/min. arterial oxygen saturation was >95% on 2 l/min of oxygen by nasal cannula; the blood gas on admission showed a pao2 of 73 mm hg, paco2 of 41 mm hg, and a ph of 7.42 on room air. his initial d-dimer was 2.6 ug/ml fibrinogen equivalent units (normal is 0.0-035 ug/ml, fibrinogen units). the chest radiograph showed bibasilar peripheral hazy opacities. a doppler study of the lower extremities was negative for venous thrombosis. the computed tomography (ct) pulmonary angiograms of his chest did not show any evidence for pulmonary emboli or emphysema, but did reveal extensive patchy bilateral ground glass opacities that were predominately in the periphery of the right middle lobe, but also present in the right and left lower lobes and the left lingula. prominent septal lines were also visible in the lung windows of the ct. the symptoms resolved spontaneously within 48 hours, and the patient was discharged home with analgesics for knee pain; no supplementary oxygen was required. unk - pulmonary function tests (pfts) performed 3 weeks after this hospitalization showed normal spirometry, and no further pulmonary testing was performed, according to the institution's therapist-directed pft <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>. while chest ct continued to show areas of ground glass opacity, the patient refused the recommended bronchoscopy since he was asymptomatic. unk - during a follow-up clinic visit 3 months later, the pulmonary consultant ordered a full set of pfts. again, the air flows were normal, as were the lung volumes, but the dlco was abnormal (19.1 ml/min/mm hg. 63% predicted). since the ground glass opacities continued to persist, the patient consented to fiberoptic bronchoscopy and an open lung biopsy. the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed macrophages with a few neutrophils and eosinophils; benign bronchial epithelial cells were also present. a 2-dimensional echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function, with no important valvular abnormalities. the biopsy performed on the right middle lobe, which showed respiratory bronchiolitis with an amorphous substance present in many medium and small pulmonary arteries. lymphatic vessels were dilated, and numerous alveolar pigmented macrophages were present. a <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b> of respiratory bronchiolitis and emphysema associated with mild bronchiolar fibrosis and focal peribronchial metaplasia was confirmed in a review of the case by the armed forces institute of pathology. a bone marrow embolus was also noted. subsequently. special stains indicated that the amorphous material contained ha co-localized with fibrin.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:this is a definitive report. this is a case report in a literature, bhagat r et al., pulmonary emboli from therapeutic sodium hyaluronate, respir care, 2012 oct; (b)(4). our medical advisor's comment: it is unlikely that only exogenous hyaluronan injected into the joint can cause an embolus after it transferred from synovial membrane to blood stream because hyaluronan exists originally in the body. it is difficult to distinguish hyaluronan from endogenous one by the detection method of hyaluronan described in this article. in fact, it is not clear whether the detected hyaluronan is exogenous hyaluronan injected into the knee joints or not. also, the report has not made clear the process how hyaluronan involved with the formation of embolus. it is recommended to monitor the similar event continuously.</p><hr><h3 id="ALG-DIAG-418">Result ALG-DIAG-418</h3><p><a

pacemaker using lifevest wearable automated defibrillator -wad- developed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia detected by the wad as an arrhythmia. inconsistencies in the analyzed arrhythmia waveform due to the presence of the unipolar ventricular pacemaker artifacts lead to termination of the treatment <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>. the vt eventually degenerated into ventricular fibrillation and the pt expired. in this case, we found there to be two potential explanations for the treatment failure. both possibilities involve misinterpretation of unipolar pacing artifacts by the wad, a potential interaction which the co identifies clearly in its literature on the device. it is possible that the wad detected the unipolar pacemaker artifacts, which in turn dominated the rate detection <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> leading to the device to interpret the heart rate as the pacing rate. alternatively, the wad may have ignored the fb channel due to chaotic signal characteristics and large pacemaker artifacts. this hypothesis is supported by the method of arrhythmia detection utilized by the device. the <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> reviews each lead for the presence of clipping -signal voltages reaching or exceeding the <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b>'s input capability-. clipping will cause the <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> to place less reliance on that particular lead. the <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> may ignore suspicious input from one lead and use the remaining lead to determine the presence or absence of an arrhythmia. qrs morphology is analyzed as a vectorcardiogram compared in real time with a template obtained during device set up. programmed rate and failure to match the template contributes to the device's determination that a treatable arrhythmia exists. however, if one of the leads is unusable, template matching is not used. instead, the <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> relies primarily on rate along with stability and onset criteria, similar to an icd. in this pt, pacing artifacts were prominent only in the fb channel and, along with the chaotic signal, are frequently clipped; making it highly probable that the fb channel was ignored in detection. as arrhythmia detection proceeded, the wad required re-analysis due to widely varying signals. when clear ventricular complexes returned, the therapy was cancelled due to the rate being less than the detection rate of 200 bpm. dates of use: twenty days in 2006. <b style='color:red;'>diagnosis</b>: 1. ventricular arrhythmias, 2. refused

sure nobody else is injured. please let me know if you need more info. i have photos, medical reports, and the electrodes that were used that still contain my burnt skin. the bottom line is, i was

zero abnormal readings and product was returned a few minutes after test was completed. that is when i discovered burn and sought immediate treatment. thank you for protecting the public health. i believe that the mfrs who produced and sold the products that generated enough heat over a 24 hour period, to cause 2nd degree electrical burns, should be required to warn their customers when heat is defectively being produced. it was unk to me that i was being burned over that 24 hr period. when electrode was removed, the pain was unbearable and the burn was seen. the cardiac monitoring recorded the whole time not indicating any problems. at the very least, the products should either shut off when they are burning somebody or an alarm should be sounded that heat is being generated defectively. phillips/(b)(4) medical holter monitor, covidien/medtronic electrodes. second degree electrical burn from holter monitor.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:</p><hr><h3

Comments</b>:(b)(4), (b)(6) 2018 for the customer report of ecg report shows normal during a heart attack the mdr/cmdr reporting investigation decision is no, and the mdr decision tree indicates no pt injury occurred on (b)(6) 2018 while an engineering report dated (b)(4) 2018 indicates the pt was treated with having a stent put in. mfg review "st changes were perhaps suggestive of myocardial ischemia with significant st segment elevation. however, in order for it to be classified as "impending myocardial infarction' or 'ischemia', very specific patterns need to be identified. while this case was perhaps close enough to those criteria, the physician could have been advised to take a closer look (with an interpretation such as "pattern partially suggestive of acute myocardial ischemia) rather than call it 'normal'. midmark's ecg system is responsible for producing a reliable and accurate waveform to the clinical team to interpret, first and foremost. in cases where an internal firmware / hardware error that causes the waveform morphology to aberrant. i am much more concerned as the clinician cannot interpret the clinical situation accurately in those cases. in this case, the waveform is not in doubt, only the interpretation we provide. but even the interpretation is not necessarily 'wrong'. in a purely classical and binary sense, this tracing did not fully qualify this pt as meeting the criteria for ischemia. "our ecg device provides the physician ecg waveform and ecg measurements / interpretation. i agree with you that reliable and accurate waveform is the most important. to ensure that the ecg device provides reliable and accurate ecg waveform, the ecg design was tested according aam ec11 (for <b style='color:red;'>diagnostic</b> ecg) and other appropriate standards and each ecg device is qc tested in house before it is shipped out. there is a small chance that a component failure may cause the inaccurate ecg waveform. this situation should already be considered in ecg risk analysis. for ecg measurements and interpretation, there was no standard available when we released our ecg software 20 years ago. we validated the ecg measurements with cse ecg database. the ecg interpretation <b style='color:red;'>algorithm</b> was also validated with some ecg database and some cardiologists. the "accuracy" of the interpretation usually is about 70-80%. therefore, as indicated in ecg ifu, the interpretation should always be reviewed / confirmed by physician." in conclusion, mfg may have admitted the waveforms were indicative of ischemic event in pt, but interpretation indicated pt was ok, which is not in line with ifu (dr must review waveform before assessing pt). pt later suffered a heart attack and had a stent placed. this was not reported as an mdr to fda. fda safety report id# (b)(4).</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:</p><hr><h3 id="ALG-DIAG-425">Result ALG-DIAG-425</h3><p><a href="https://api.fda.gov/device/event.json?search=algorithm*+AND+(diagnostic*+OR+diagnosis*)&limit=500&skip=500" target="blank">Original Source Query</a></p><p><b>Event Date</b>:unknown     <b>Report ID</b>:mw5115004     <b>Report Source Code</b>:voluntary report</p><p><b>Device Specialty Area</b>:general hospital     <b>Device Class</b>:2</p><p><b>Device Reg Number</b>:unknown     <b>Device Name</b>:pump, infusion</p><p><b>Device Model Number</b>:7400     <b>Device Catalogue Number</b>:unknown     <b>Device Lot Number</b>: unknown</p><p></p><p><b>Product Problems</b>:program or algorithm execution problem|therapeutic or diagnostic output failure</p><p><b>Patient Problems</b>:respiratory insufficiency</p><p><b>Event Main Comments</b>:patient reports that they were hospitalized from (b)(6) 2023 due to shortness of breath and fluid in their lungs. patient states md is aware. onset and resolution dates/status of symptoms unknown. patient also reports that while hospitalized, pump serial number (b)(4) maintenance due 01/12/2024 lost programming. patient did not state when they noticed that the pump had lost programming. unknown if patient had the malfunctioning pump with them in the hospital. patient has been infusing on their back up pump, no break in therapy. pharmacy is replacing malfunctioning pump. no further info, details or dates available. sq remodulin ms3 patient. did the reported product fault occur while in use with the pt? no; did the product issue cause or contribute to pt or clinical injury? no; is the actual device available for investigation? yes; did we [mfr] replace the device? yes; did the pt have a backup device they were able to switch to? yes. was the pt able to successfully continue their infusion? yes; is the infusion life-sustaining? yes. reported to (b)(6) by pt/caregiver.</p><p><b>Event Manufacturer Comments</b>:</p><hr></body></html>
