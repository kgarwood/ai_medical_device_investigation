Welcome to the Open FDA AI Medical Device Investigation. This is the main module
that runs the investigation. It uses the Open FDA Device API to search for three
kinds of medical devices. They include those which:

(1) mention 'artificial intelligence' or 'machine learning'
(2) mention 'algorithm'
(3) mention 'algorithm' and either 'diagnostic' or 'diagnosis'
