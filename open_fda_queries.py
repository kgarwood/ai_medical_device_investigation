"""
This module tries to isolate the code used to execute a query applied to the Open FDA Device API. The queries
here support an investigation of identifying the kinds of operational issues that may be associated with
AI-driven medical devices.

Open FDA can support sophisticated queries, but I've chosen simple ones for the sake of making a simple
demonstration. Trying to identify search terms that would return results about artificial intelligence proved
challenging.

Using phrases like 'artificial intelligence' or 'AI' or 'machine learning' or 'ML' returned too
many results. AI and ML are vague, with AI sometimes describing application interface and ML describing millilitre.
Of the few search results that match on 'machine learning' or 'artificial intelligence', most of the reports are
manufacture reports that try to respond to a new piece of research literature that happens to have these phrases in
the journal title.

Searching for 'algorithm' generated too many results, with many of the reports likely to describe software problems
for devices that were not about 'artificial intelligence' or 'machine learning'. However, algorithm does provide
insights into problems for software-driven medical devices in general.

I finally decided to focus on results that mentioned 'algorithm' and either 'diagnostic' or 'diagnosis'. This limits
the kinds of device contexts I encountered, but this approach yielded results that were large enough to show variety
but small enough to process by eye.
